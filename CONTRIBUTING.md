# Contributing to Fivetran Connector SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Fivetran Connector SDK. This repository is an open-source collection of examples demonstrating how to build custom data connectors using the Fivetran Connector SDK. We welcome contributions from the community to expand and improve this collection.

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Ways to contribute

We encourage the community to contribute in the following ways:

- New connector examples - add examples for popular APIs, databases, or data sources
- Bug fixes - fix issues in existing connector examples
- Performance improvements - optimize existing connectors for better performance
- Code quality improvements - refactor code to follow best practices
- New common patterns - add reusable patterns and utilities that benefit multiple connectors

## Getting started

Before contributing, do the following:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Connector SDK documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk).
2. Browse the [existing examples](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/README.md#examples) to understand our coding patterns and structure.
3. Set up your environment - follow the [setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to install the Connector SDK.


## How to fork and create a pull request

### Step 1: Fork the repository

1. Navigate to the [Fivetran Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk) on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork** in the upper-right corner of the page.
3. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone your fork

```bash
# Clone your forked repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/fivetran_connector_sdk.git

# Navigate to the repository directory
cd fivetran_connector_sdk

# Add the original repository as an upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk.git
```

### Step 3: Set up pre-commit hooks

To set up the pre-commit hook, execute `.github/scripts/setup-hooks.sh` from the root of the repository for automatic code formatting.


### Step 4: Create a feature branch

```bash
# Ensure your main branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new branch for your feature or fix
git checkout -b feature/your-example-name
```

Use descriptive branch names such as:
- `feature/salesforce-connector`
- `fix/pagination-bug-in-hubspot`

### Step 5: Make your changes

Before making any changes, define the scope of the connector example you want to contribute. For new examples, the examples should be added in a new directory under relevant section. For updating existing examples, you can either make changes directly in the existing connector's directory or create a new subdirectory under the existing connector.

If the changes are substantial, you should create a new connector example to maintain clarity and organization. For change that are universally applicable for the existing example such as performance improvements, code quality improvements, or bug fixes, you should make changes directly in the existing connector's directory.

After defining the scope, you should do the following:

1. Create or modify connector examples in the appropriate directory.
2. Ensure your code follows our [coding standards](#contribution-standards-and-guidelines).
3. Test your connector thoroughly using `fivetran debug`. Refer to the [building custom connector tutorial](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/tutorials/beginners-tutorial#installthefivetranconnectorsdk). 
4. Add or update documentation as needed.

### Step 6: Commit your changes

```bash
# Stage all your local changes
git add .

# Or, stage specific files
git add connectors/your_connector_name/connector.py

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "brief description of changes"
```

### Step 7: Push to your fork

```bash
# Push your branch to your forked repository
git push origin feature/your-example-name

# Or, if you are updating an existing branch
git push
```

### Step 8: Create a pull request

1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the `Compare & pull request` button.
3. Ensure the base repository is `fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk` and the base branch is `main`.
4. Fill out the pull request template with:
   - Clear title message
   - Detailed description of your changes
   - Screenshot of `fivetran debug` output (see [Testing Requirements](#testing-requirements))
   - Any additional context for reviewers

### Step 9: Keep your branch updated

```bash
# Sync your fork with the upstream repository
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Rebase your feature branch if needed
git checkout feature/your-example-name
git rebase main
```

You can also use your IDE's interface to manage branches and resolve conflicts.

## Contribution standards and guidelines

All contributions must adhere to our coding standards and principles to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across the repository.

### Required reading

Before submitting a pull request, thoroughly review these documents:

- [Python Coding Standards](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/PYTHON_CODING_STANDARDS.md) - comprehensive guidelines for Python code style, naming conventions, and best practices
- [Fivetran Coding Principles](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/FIVETRAN_CODING_PRINCIPLES.md) - high-level principles for code reviews, PR guidelines, and example development
- [Connector SDK Best Practices](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/best-practices) - official documentation on best practices

### Documentation requirements

Every new connector example contribution must include proper documentation:

#### README.md

Each new connector example must include a `README.md` file in its directory. Refer to the [template connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/template_connector) for structure and formatting.

#### Root README.md update

When adding a new connector example, you must update the root [README.md](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/README.md) file to include your example in the appropriate section.


## Review process

All pull requests go through a multi-stage review process to ensure quality and consistency. Each pull request should ensure it meets the following requirements before it can be merged:
- Passes all automated checks
- Reviewed by GitHub Copilot
- Receives two approvals from Fivetran team members
- Addresses all review feedback

### Stage 1: Automated checks

When you submit a pull request, automated checks will run:

- Code quality check - Flake8 linting and Black formatting validation
- README update check - verifies that the root README.md is updated for new examples
- CLA verification - confirms that you have signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

The code quality and README update checks will run only when a Fivetran team member allows the check to run when the PR is opened. These checks must pass before human review begins.

### Stage 2: GitHub Copilot review

GitHub Copilot performs an initial automated review to:

- Identify logical and formatting issues
- Detect potential bottlenecks and performance problems
- Ensure code follows Fivetran Connector SDK guidelines
- Check for common security vulnerabilities

Address any feedback from Copilot before requesting human review. If you disagree with any suggestions generated by Copilot, you can provide a clear explanation in the comments to facilitate discussion.

### Stage 3: Human review

Your pull request requires two approvals from the Fivetran team:

#### Documentation review

A Fivetran team member will review:
- `README.md` completeness and clarity
- Alignment with our documentation standards

#### Code review

A Fivetran team member will review:
- Code quality and architecture
- Adherence to coding standards
- Functionality and correctness
- Performance considerations
- Security best practices


### Addressing review feedback

1. Acknowledge each review comment.
2. Update your code based on feedback.
3. Push Updates: Commit and push changes to your branch.
4. Once all feedback is addressed, request re-review from reviewers.
5. Mark conversations as resolved when addressed.

## Pull request checks

Your pull request must pass the following automated checks before it can be merged:

### 1. Python code quality check

This check uses Flake8 and Black to ensure code quality and formatting:

#### Flake8 linting

This check identifies potential errors, stylistic issues, and deviations from PEP8 python coding standards. It uses `.flake8` config file at the repository root. The check only analyzes Python files modified in your pull request and fails if any flake8 errors are detected.

To check for flake8 errors locally:
```bash
# Install flake8
pip install flake8

# Run this command from the directory of your connector example
flake8 .
```

#### Black formatting

This check ensures that all Python code adheres to the Black code formatter standards defined in the repository. It checks all Python files in the repository for compliance with Black formatting rules and fails if any formatting issues are detected.

To fix formatting issues locally:
```bash
# Run this command from the root of the repository
./.github/scripts/fix-python-formatting.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Install black 
pip install black

# Check and fix formatting
black --line-length 99 .
```

### 2. README update check

This check ensures that new examples are documented in the root `README.md`. This check runs when your pull request adds new directories. This check fails if new directories are added without updating the root `README.md` to document them.

What to update in `README.md`:
- Add your connector to the appropriate section (Community Connectors, Quickstart Examples, etc.)
- Include a brief description
- Link to your connector's directory

### 3. Contributor license agreement

All contributors must sign the Fivetran CLA before their contributions can be accepted. You can review the CLA [here](https://cla-assistant.io/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk).

#### How the CLA works

- When you submit your first pull request, the CLA bot will automatically comment on your PR.
- Follow the link provided by the bot to sign the CLA electronically
- Once you have signed the CLA, the bot will automatically verify and update your PR status

You only need to sign the CLA once for all future contributions.

## Testing requirements

All connector contributions must be thoroughly tested before submission. Testing ensures that your connector works correctly and helps maintain the quality of the repository.

### Local testing with `fivetran debug`

Before submitting your pull request, you must test your connector locally using the `fivetran debug` command:

#### Step 1: Install the connector SDK

```bash
pip install fivetran-connector-sdk
```

#### Step 2: Test your connector

```bash
# Navigate to your connector directory
cd connectors/your_connector_name

# Run the debug command
fivetran debug

# If your connector uses configuration file, run
fivetran debug --configuration=configuration.json
```

#### Step 3: Verify the output

After running `fivetran debug`, verify that the output indicates a successful run without errors. You should also verify the `warehouse.db` file to ensure data has been extracted and loaded correctly. For more information on working with the `warehouse.db` file, refer to the [Connector SDK documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/working-with-connector-sdk#workingwithwarehousedb).

#### Step 4: Take a screenshot and add to your PR

Capture a screenshot of the successful `fivetran debug` output and attach the screenshot in the PR description.
Ensure that you hide any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive data in the screenshot before attaching it to your PR.
