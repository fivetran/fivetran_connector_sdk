# Overview
Explore practical examples and helpful resources for building custom data connectors with the Fivetran [Connector SDK](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk). Learn how to develop and deploy [custom data connectors](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) in Python, and extend Fivetran’s capabilities to fit your data integration needs.

You’ll also find tips on [using AI to help you code an SDK connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/ai_and_connector_sdk/README.md) quickly.

## Why Connector SDK?
Fivetran Connector SDK allows you to code a custom data connector using Python and deploy it as an extension of Fivetran. Fivetran automatically manages running Connector SDK connections on your scheduled frequency and manages the required compute resources, eliminating the need for a third-party provider.

Connector SDK provides native support for many Fivetran features and relies on existing Fivetran technology. It also eliminates timeout and data size limitations seen in AWS Lambda.

## Requirements
- Python ≥3.9 and ≤3.12
- Operating System:
  - Windows 10 or later
  - MacOS 13 (Ventura) or later

## Getting started

See [Setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Support

## Additional considerations

We provide examples to help you effectively use Fivetran's Connector SDK. While we've tested the code provided in these examples, Fivetran cannot be held responsible for any unexpected or negative consequences that may arise from using these examples.

Note that API calls made by your Connector SDK connection may count towards your service’s API call allocation. Exceeding this limit could trigger rate limits, potentially impacting other uses of the source API.

It's important to choose the right design pattern for your target API. Using an inappropriate pattern may lead to data integrity issues. We recommend that you review all our examples carefully to select the one that best suits your target API. Keep in mind that some APIs may not support patterns for which we currently have examples.

As with other new connectors, SDK connectors have a [14-day trial period](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/free-trials#newconnectorfreeuseperiod) during which your usage counts towards free [MAR](https://fivetran.com/docs/usage-based-pricing). After the 14-day trial period, your usage counts towards paid MAR. To avoid incurring charges, pause or delete any connections you created to run these examples before the trial ends.

## Maintenance
The `fivetran_connector_sdk` repository is actively maintained by Fivetran Developers. Reach out to our [Support team](https://support.fivetran.com/hc/en-us) for any inquiries.
