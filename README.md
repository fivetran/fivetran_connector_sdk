# Overview
Explore practical examples and helpful resources for building custom data connectors with the Fivetran [Connector SDK](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk). Learn how to develop and deploy [custom data connectors](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) in Python, and extend Fivetran’s capabilities to fit your data integration needs.

You’ll also find tips on [using AI to help you code an SDK connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/ai_and_connector_sdk/AI_README.md) quickly.

## Why Connector SDK?
Fivetran Connector SDK allows you to code a custom data connector using Python and deploy it as an extension of Fivetran. Fivetran automatically manages running Connector SDK connections on your scheduled frequency and manages the required compute resources, eliminating the need for a third-party provider.

Connector SDK provides native support for many Fivetran features and relies on existing Fivetran technology. It also eliminates timeout and data size limitations seen in AWS Lambda.

## Requirements
- Python version ≥3.9 and ≤3.12
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

See [Setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

Run the `.github/scripts/setup-hooks.sh` script from the root of the repository to set up pre-commit hooks. This ensures that your code is formatted correctly and passes all tests before you commit them.

## Examples

> Note: To simplify the processeses of building and maintaining connectors with Connector SDK, we've removed the need to use the Python generator pattern, `yield`, starting with Connector SDK version 2.0.0. This change is fully backward compatible, so your existing Connector SDK connections will continue to function without modification. For more information, refer to our [Connector SDK release notes](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/changelog#august2025).

- [toast](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/source_examples/toast) - This is an example of how we can sync Toast data using the Connector SDK. You would need to provide your Toast credentials for this example to work.
- veeva vault
  - [basic_auth](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/source_examples/veeva_vault/basic_auth) - This example shows how to authenticate to Veeva Vault using basic authentication and sync records from Veeva Vault. You need to provide your Veeva Vault credentials for this example to work.
  - [session_id_auth](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/source_examples/veeva_vault/session_id_auth) - This example shows how to authenticate to Veeva Vault using session id authentication and sync records from Veeva Vault. You need to provide your Veeva Vault credentials for this example to work.

<summary><h2>Private Preview features</h2></summary>

>**NOTE:** The following features are in Private Preview. Please connect with our professional services to get more information about them and enable it for your connector.
- **[Importing External Libraries and Drivers](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/private_preview_features/importing_external_drivers)**
  - This feature enables you to install drivers in your connector environment by writing a `installation.sh` file in the `drivers` folder, in the same directory as your connector.py file. This script will be executed at the time of deploying your connector, before your connector.py is run to sync your data.
- **[Sybase IQ](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/private_preview_features/sybase_iq)**
  - This feature enables you to connect to Sybase IQ database using the `FreeTDS` driver and `PyODBC` by writing a `installation.sh` file in the `drivers` folder. This script will be executed at the time of deploying your connector, before your connector.py is run to sync your data.
- **[Sybase ASE](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/private_preview_features/sybase_ase)**
  - This feature enables you to connect to Sybase ASE database using the `FreeTDS` driver and `PyODBC` by writing a `installation.sh` file in the `drivers` folder. This script will be executed at the time of deploying your connector, before your connector.py is run to sync your data.
- **[ibm_infomix_using_jaydebeapi](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/private_preview_features/ibm_infomix_using_jaydebeapi)**
  - This example shows how to connect and sync data from IBM Informix using Connector SDK. This example uses the `jaydebeapi` library with external JDBC Informix driver, using `installation.sh` file in the `drivers` folder, to connect to the Informix database and fetch data.

## AI and Connector SDK
 - [AI_Readme](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/ai_and_connector_sdk/AI_README.md) - This is an introduction to using AI tools to leverage Connector SDK
 - [claude_20250228](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/ai_and_connector_sdk/claude_20250228/) - This example contains the code produced by Claude AI to build a custom connector using our Connector SDK. See our [blog article](https://www.fivetran.com/blog/building-a-fivetran-connector-in-1-hour-with-anthropics-claude-ai) for details.

> Note: As of Connector SDK version 2.0.0, `yield` is no longer required for Connector SDK operations. This folder contains examples that still use `yield`, but we recommend using the latest version of Connector SDK and avoiding `yield` in your connector code. For more information, refer to our [Connector SDK release notes](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/changelog#august2025).

## Fivetran platform features
- [schema_change](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/fivetran_platform_features/schema_change/README.md) - This is an example that illustrates how a deployed Connector SDK connection uses Fivetran's native [data type changes](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts#changingdatatype) to change data types in the destination if they are changed in the source data.


## Support
Learn how we [support Fivetran Connector SDK](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk#support).

## Additional considerations

We provide examples to help you effectively use Fivetran's Connector SDK. While we've tested the code provided in these examples, Fivetran cannot be held responsible for any unexpected or negative consequences that may arise from using these examples.

Note that API calls made by your Connector SDK connection may count towards your service’s API call allocation. Exceeding this limit could trigger rate limits, potentially impacting other uses of the source API.

It's important to choose the right design pattern for your target API. Using an inappropriate pattern may lead to data integrity issues. We recommend that you review all our examples carefully to select the one that best suits your target API. Keep in mind that some APIs may not support patterns for which we currently have examples.

As with other new connectors, SDK connectors have a [14-day trial period](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/free-trials#newconnectorfreeuseperiod) during which your usage counts towards free [MAR](https://fivetran.com/docs/usage-based-pricing). After the 14-day trial period, your usage counts towards paid MAR. To avoid incurring charges, pause or delete any connections you created to run these examples before the trial ends.

## Maintenance
The `fivetran_connector_sdk` repository is actively maintained by Fivetran Developers. Reach out to our [Support team](https://support.fivetran.com/hc/en-us) for any inquiries.
