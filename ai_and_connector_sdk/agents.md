import json

# Standard connector initialization
connector = Connector(update=update, schema=schema)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("/configuration.json", 'r') as f:
        configuration = json.load(f)
    connector.debug(configuration=configuration)
```

4. LOGGING STANDARDS
```python
# INFO - Status updates, cursors, progress
log.info(f'Current cursor: {current_cursor}')

# WARNING - Potential issues, rate limits
log.warning(f'Rate limit approaching: {remaining_calls}')

# SEVERE - Errors, failures, critical issues
log.severe(f"Error details: {error_details}")
```

## Technical Requirements

1. SCHEMA DEFINITION
- Only define table names and primary keys in schema method
- Example:
```python
def schema(configuration: dict):
    return [
        {"table": "table_name", "primary_key": ["key"]}
    ]
```

2. DATA OPERATIONS (NO YIELD REQUIRED)

- Implement proper state management using checkpoints
- Handle pagination correctly
- Support incremental syncs
- Example:
```python
# Upsert without yield - direct operation
op.upsert("table_name", processed_data)

# Checkpoint with state for incremental syncs
op.checkpoint(state=new_state)

# Update existing records
op.update(table, modified)

# Marking records as deleted
op.delete(table, keys)
```

3. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
- Generate configuration.json template
- All values must be strings
- Include authentication fields
- Document validation rules
- Example:
```json
{
    "api_key": "string",
    "base_url": "string",
    "rate_limit": "string"
}
```

        cleaned = clean_ai_data(record)
        # Feature engineering
        enriched = enrich_features(cleaned)
        processed.append(enriched)
    return processed

# Schema evolution handling

""" Add your source-specific imports here
Example: import pandas, boto3, etc.

import json


"""
GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW WHILE WRITING A CONNECTOR:
- Import only the necessary modules and libraries to keep the code clean and efficient.
- Use clear, consistent and descriptive names for your functions and variables.
- For constants and global variables, use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g. CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL, TABLE_NAME).
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each function in the docstring.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of complex logic within functions, where necessary.
- Add comments to highlight where users can make changes to the code to suit their specific use case.
- Split your code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability where required.
- Use logging to provide useful information about the connector's execution. Do not log excessively.
- Implement error handling to catch exceptions and log them appropriately. Catch specific exceptions where possible.
- Define the complete data model with primary key and data types in the schema function.
- Ensure that the connector does not load all data into memory at once. This can cause memory overflow errors. Use pagination or streaming where possible.
- Add comments to explain pagination or streaming logic to help users understand how to handle large datasets.
- Add comments for upsert, update and delete to explain the purpose of upsert, update and delete. This will help users understand the upsert, update and delete processes.
- Checkpoint your state at regular intervals to ensure that the connector can resume from the last successful sync in case of interruptions.
- Add comments for checkpointing to explain the purpose of checkpoint. This will help users understand the checkpointing process.
- Refer to the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices)
- Optimize for AI/ML data characteristics and processing patterns.

- Focus on enterprise-grade quality

# This is an example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
""" Add one line description of your connector here.

"""
GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW WHILE WRITING A CONNECTOR:
- Import only the necessary modules and libraries to keep the code clean and efficient.
- Use clear, consistent and descriptive names for your functions and variables.
- For constants and global variables, use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g. CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL, TABLE_NAME).
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each function in the docstring.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of complex logic within functions, where necessary.
- Add comments to highlight where users can make changes to the code to suit their specific use case.
- Split your code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability where required.
- Use logging to provide useful information about the connector's execution. Do not log excessively.
- Implement error handling to catch exceptions and log them appropriately. Catch specific exceptions where possible.
- Define the complete data model with primary key and data types in the schema function.
- Ensure that the connector does not load all data into memory at once. This can cause memory overflow errors. Use pagination or streaming where possible.
- Add comments to explain pagination or streaming logic to help users understand how to handle large datasets.
- Add comments for upsert, update and delete to explain the purpose of upsert, update and delete. This will help users understand the upsert, update and delete processes.
- Checkpoint your state at regular intervals to ensure that the connector can resume from the last successful sync in case of interruptions.
- Add comments for checkpointing to explain the purpose of checkpoint. This will help users understand the checkpointing process.
- Refer to the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices)
- Optimize for AI/ML data characteristics and processing patterns.
