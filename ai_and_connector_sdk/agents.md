## Example Response Structure
When responding to requests like "Can you make me a Y connector?", follow this structure:

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Design methodology to test, debug and validate the connector and execute it
- Suggest monitoring approaches
- Outline troubleshooting steps

### 5. Analyze provided files in the file search context

### 6. Generate complete connector SDK implementations including:
- **connector.py**: Main connector implementation
- **requirements.txt**: All required dependencies. Do not include fivetran-connector-sdk or requests as they are already present.
- **configuration.json**: Configuration template for any key:value pairs necessary for the connector.py. All values must be string in this file.

## File Analysis Rules
- When files are attached, thoroughly analyze their structure and dependencies
- Identify key interfaces, methods, and data structures that need to be implemented
- Note any specific version requirements or compatibility constraints

## Code Generation Guidelines

### Required Imports
```python
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector, Logging as log, Operations as op
import json
```

### Logging Standards
- **INFO** - for all informational logs such as status, start, pause, exit, etc.
  ```python
  log.info(f'Current cursor: {current_cursor}')
  ```
- **WARNING** - for less severe error conditions that could degrade the flow in the future if not addressed.
- **SEVERE** - for error conditions and failures that cause significant issues to current flows and execution.
  ```python
  log.severe(f"Error details: {error_details}")
  ```

### Code Standards
- Generate production-ready, PEP 8 compliant Python code
- Include comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow security best practices for handling credentials
- Ensure all dependencies are explicitly listed with versions

### Upsert Operations
The upsert must use yield:
```python
# Upsert the data
yield op.upsert("demo_response_test", processed_data)
```

### Connector Initialization
Include complete and functional code with a single file for each connector.py, requirements.txt and configuration.json:

```python
# Initialize the connector with the defined update and schema functions
connector = Connector(update=update, schema=schema)

# Entry point for running the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open("/configuration.json", 'r') as f:
        configuration = json.load(f)  # Load configuration from JSON file
    connector.debug(configuration=configuration)  # Start debugging with a specific configuration
```

### Schema Method
The schema method in the connector.py must only declare the primary key for the tables:
```python
def schema(configuration: dict):
    """
    Define the schema for the connector.
    """
    return [
        {"table": "demo_response_test", "primary_key": ["key"]}
    ]
```

## Fivetran Operations

### Upsert()
```python
upsert(table="three", data=data)
```
Writes data to the target table, using the defined primary keys of the table to either create a new row or update an existing row. Columns present in your table and not present in the data passed in the method will be populated with NULL.

The data parameter accepts a Python dictionary (similar to a JSON object) that holds key-value pairs. The key represents the name of a column in the target table, and the value represents the value to be upserted. The data type of the value can be any of the supported data types. It is crucial to ensure the data type of the value matches the data type defined in the table's schema for the corresponding column.

### Update()
```python
update(table="three", modified=data)
```
Writes data to the table using the primary keys to identify which row to update. This operation does not write data with new primary keys to your destination. Columns present in your table and not present in the data passed in the method will be left unchanged.

The modified parameter accepts a Python dictionary (similar to JSON object) that holds key-value pairs. The key represents the name of a column in the target table, and the value represents the value to be updated. The data type of the value can be any of the supported data types.

```python
modified = {
    "primary_key_column": "value",
    "column_1": "value",
    "column_2": "value"
}
```
**NOTE**: If there is a composite primary key containing multiple columns, all the columns must be present inside the dictionary for the correct row update.

### Delete()
```python
delete(table="three", keys=data)
```
Sets the _fivetran_deleted column value to TRUE for rows with the provided primary keys in the target table.

The keys parameter accepts a Python dictionary (similar to a JSON object) that specifies the rows to be marked as deleted. It contains key-value pairs where the key is the name of a primary key column in the table and the value is the value of that primary key column for the row to be deleted.

```python
keys = {
    "primary_key_column": "value"
}
```
**NOTE**: If there is a composite primary key comprising multiple columns, all the columns must be present inside the dictionary for the correct row to be marked as deleted.

### Checkpoint()
```python
checkpoint(state=new_state)
```
Updates state: dict with new_state and tells Fivetran that the data sent up until this point can be safely written to your destination. This is used to enable incremental syncs as well as safely break large syncs ensuring data is delivered to the destination periodically. Fivetran does not save any values in state automatically; only the contents of new_state are applied as they are passed. You must pass the state as a JSON string that represents a single JSON object (i.e., the decoded result must be a dictionary — not an array, string, or number).

See the following example structure and contents of a state.json file:
```json
{
    "company_cursor": "2024-08-14T02:01:00Z",
    "department_cursor": {
        "1": "2024-08-14T03:00:00Z",
        "2": "2024-08-14T06:00:00Z"
    },
    "offset": 80
}
```

## Configuration File Rules
Generate a configuration.json template as follows:
- All values must be string
- It should include all fields required for authentication
- Also include any optional configuration parameters
- Include example values and descriptions for each field
- Include clear validation rules

## Testing the connector
You can test your connector in two ways:

### 1. Terminal 
There is an installed CLI app called "fivetran" that you can use to test the connector.
In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `connector.py` file and run:
```bash
$ fivetran debug
```

To test the connector with configuration values specified in `configuration.json` file, pass it as an argument:
```bash
$ fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json
```

### 2. Python
You can also run debug from python script, include the following snippet in `connector.py`:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    connector.debug()
```

Both methods create `<project_directory>/files/warehouse.db`. This is a DuckDB database file that mimics the data the connection delivers to your destination.

Both methods output a log to the terminal. The final lines of the debug log look similar to this example:
```
Apr 11, 2025 01:28:06 PM: INFO Fivetran-Tester-Process: SYNC PROGRESS:

Operation     | Calls
------------- + ------------
Upserts       | 44
Updates       | 0
Deletes       | 0
Truncates     | 0
SchemaChanges | 1
Checkpoints   | 1

Apr 11, 2025 01:28:06 PM: INFO Fivetran-Tester-Process: Sync SUCCEEDED
```

For more examples of test logs, see the [Fivetran Connector SDK technical reference](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference#logexample).

## Validating the destination
Inspect the DuckDB database file at `<project_directory>/files/warehouse.db` using duckdb cli app if available or duckdb package in python. Verify that the source data that the connector wrote to the destination is present in this file in full. You should consider logging the data you send to the destination so that you can validate that it is in the destination in full.
