# Pokemon API Connector Tutorial

## What This Tutorial Does

This tutorial is intended to be read in tandem with our [Building a Fivetran Connector in 1 Hour with Claude AI](https://www.fivetran.com/blog/building-a-fivetran-connector-in-1-hour-with-anthropics-claude-ai) blog post that was published in March 2024. You will build a **Fivetran Connector** that automatically syncs Pokemon data from the PokeAPI. You'll learn how we:

- Setup Claude to run in our terminal
- Cloned the Fivetran Connector SDK Examples to provide context
- Worked with and prompted Claude
- Itterated and tested the Connector code Claude generated
- Deployed the connector and saw it running int production

**Perfect for**: Data engineers, analysts, and developers who want to try out creating connectors with AI.

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- **Python 3.9 - 3.12+** installed on your machine
- **Basic Python knowledge** (functions, dictionaries, loops)
- **Fivetran Connector SDK** (we'll install this)
- **Git** (optional, for version control)

### API Access
- **PokeAPI** (completely free, no authentication required)
  - Public API endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
  - No rate limits for basic usage
  - Comprehensive Pokemon data available

### Development Environment
- **Access to Claude** (In terminal like the blog, in IDE chat or independant web access)
- **Terminal/Command line** access
- **Internet connection** for API calls

## Required Files

2 core files got generated to create this Connector SDK:

### 1. `connector.py` - Main Connector Logic
```python
# This is your main connector file
# Contains all the Pokemon API connecion logic
# Handles data fetching, processing, and passing to Fivetran
```

### 2. `config.json` - Settings
```json
{
    "limit": "100",
    "request_delay": "1.0",
    "api_base_url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2"
}
```

### 3. `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
no additional dependencies for this API are needed so this file was correctly skipped by the AI agent.

## The Prompt

Here's the original prompt that created this connector:

> Iâ€™d like you to help me create and test a Fivetran connector SDK connector to gather lots of data from the PokÃ©API and deliver that into my destination in Fivetran.

Then
> now I want to test the connector

That was it for this case. We weren't particularly bothered by what data was sync'ed or it schema. In this exploration 4 tables were successfully created and populated.

## How to try out the claude code created during the blog

1. **Create your project folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir pokemon-connector
   cd pokemon-connector
   ```

2. **Copy the two files** above into your folder
   You don't need the state.json and warehouse.db from the files/ directory they are autogenerated when you run `fivetran debug` for local testing and are included for completeness and independent inspection. 

3. **Test the connector**:
   ```bash
   fivetran debug --configuration config.json
   ```

6. **Check your data**:
   ```bash
   duckdb files/warehouse.db ".tables"
   duckdb files/warehouse.db "SELECT * FROM tester.pokemon"
   ```

## Next Steps

Once you've got the connector claude gereated for us working:

1. **Extract more fields** ask AI to help change the schema or add more endpoints
2. **Add custom data transformations** work with AI to change how the data is represented in your destination
3. **Implement batch processing** for multiple Pokemon
4. **Add data validation** for quality assurance
5. **Deploy to production** with proper monitoring
6. **Try different models** see our other tutorials

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Timeout**: Increase timeout value in requests.get()
2. **Field Extraction Errors**: Check API response structure
3. **JSON Conversion Issues**: Verify data types before conversion
4. **Primary Key Conflicts**: Ensure unique key generation

### API Response Structure

The PokeAPI returns complex nested JSON. Our connector:
- Extracts only the top-level fields
- Converts nested structures to JSON strings
- Maintains data integrity while simplifying storage

- **Fivetran SDK Docs**: https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk
- **Pokemon Database**: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
- **API Status**: https://pokeapi.co/

## Example Output

After running the connector, you'll see data like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pokemon;
```
