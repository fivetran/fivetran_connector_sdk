Authentication
An API key is required to make calls to the openFDA API. The key is free of charge. Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use. These limitations are designed to manage load on the system, promote equitable access, and prevent abuse. Here are openFDA's standard limits:

With no API key: 240 requests per minute, per IP address. 1,000 requests per day, per IP address.

With an API key: 240 requests per minute, per key. 120,000 requests per day, per key.

If you anticipate usage above the limits provided by an API key, please contact us. We’ll work with you to figure out a good solution to your requirements. Signing up for an API key means you agree to our terms of service.

 Get your API key
Using your API key
Your API key should be passed to the API as the value of the api_key parameter. Include it before other parameters, such as the search parameter. For example:

https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?api_key=yourAPIKeyHere&search=...

HTTPS requests only
Alternatively your API key may be provided as a basic auth username. For example:

Authorization: Basic eW91ckFQSUtleUhlcmU6

openFDA requires you to use https://api.fda.gov for all queries to ensure secure communication.

How to use the API
Getting started with and learning how to use the API is relatively straightforward. Here are some recommended steps:

1
If you haven't already, read the API Basics documentation.
2
Review the list of searchable fields available in the Tobacco Problem Reports dataset.
3
Try out the Tobacco Problem Reports endpoint using the interactive examples and tools below.
Then, when you are ready, obtain an API Key. While you don’t need an API Key to try or use the API, we recommend you get one if you are planning to use the API on a regular basis. For more information on API Keys, see the Authentication documentation.

Making a simple API Call
You can call the API from a web browser. Simply type a valid API query in your browser’s address bar and press the Enter key.

In the example below, we are searching the records in the tobacco problem reports endpoint for matches with report_id with the value 2082161. We are requesting to see the first 5 records that match."

Some key pointers
An openFDA API query always begins with the base endpoint, which in this case is: https://api.fda.gov/tobacco/problem.json
Searches have a special syntax: search=field:term
Unless otherwise specified, the API will return only one matching record for a search. You can specify the number of records to be returned by using the limit parameter. The maximum limit allowed is 1000 for any single API call. If no limit is set, the API will return one matching record.
It is possible to construct very complex queries using the openFDA API. Review the Construct the query documentation to learn more about all the available query parameters, how to handle quotations, spaces, phrase matches, and groupings, how to search on dates and ranges, and more.

Example query

Problem reports by tobacco product
The suffix .exact is required by openFDA to count the unique full phrases in the field product_type. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individually—Firm Initiated would be counted as separate values, Firm and Initiated.
