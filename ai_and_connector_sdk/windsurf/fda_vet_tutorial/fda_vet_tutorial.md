# FDA Veterinary API Connector Tutorial

## What This Tutorial Does

This tutorial walks you through building a **Fivetran Connector** that automatically syncs data from the FDA Veterinary API using **Windsurf IDE**. You'll learn how to:

- Connect to FDA's public veterinary adverse events database (no API key required to start)
- Automatically sync veterinary adverse event reports with proper data flattening
- Implement incremental syncing to only fetch new/updated data
- Handle rate limiting and API quotas gracefully
- Structure data for analytics with flattened tables
- Leverage Windsurf IDE's advanced AI capabilities for connector development

**Perfect for**: Data engineers, analysts, and developers who want to build reliable data pipelines for veterinary pharmaceutical data using modern AI-powered development tools.

## The Prompt

Here's the original prompt that created this connector using Windsurf IDE:

> "Create a Fivetran Connector SDK solution for the FDA Veterinary API that includes:
> 
> - Veterinary adverse events endpoint integration
> - Incremental syncing using date fields and unique identifiers
> - Configurable data flattening for nested JSON structures
> - Rate limiting and quota management
> - Support for both authenticated and unauthenticated access
> - Robust state management for reliable incremental syncs
> - Proper upserts based on unique_aer_id_number as primary key
> - Follow the best practices outlined in Windsurf IDE development guide
> - Include utility functions for data transformation
> 
> The connector should work with the FDA Veterinary API endpoint for adverse events and handle the complex nested structure of veterinary adverse event reports."

## Quick Start with Windsurf IDE

1. **Open Windsurf IDE** and create a new workspace:
   ```bash
   # In Windsurf terminal
   mkdir fda-vet-connector
   cd fda-vet-connector
   ```

2. **Use Windsurf AI** to generate the connector:
   - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to open AI chat
   - Copy the prompt above into the chat
   - Ask Windsurf to generate the complete connector implementation

3. **Review and customize** the generated code:
   - Windsurf AI will create all necessary files
   - Review the code structure and make any customizations
   - Use `Cmd/Ctrl + L` for inline code generation if needed

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # In Windsurf terminal
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install fivetran-connector-sdk
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Test the connector**:
   ```bash
   # In Windsurf terminal
   fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json
   ```

6. **Check your data**:
   ```bash
   # In Windsurf terminal
   duckdb warehouse.db ".tables"
   duckdb warehouse.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;"
   ```

## Code Structure Explanation

### Main Connector Logic (`connector.py`)
```python

from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector, Logging as log, Operations as op

# Schema definition with primary key
def schema(configuration: dict):
    return [
        {"table": "events", "primary_key": ["unique_aer_id_number"]}
    ]

# Main update function with proper operations
def update(configuration: dict, state: dict = None):
    # Fetch data from FDA Veterinary API
    # Process and flatten each event
    # Yield upsert operations
    # Checkpoint after each record
```

### Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
```python
# Data transformation utilities
def flatten_dict(nested_dict, parent_key='', sep='_'):
