# Cursor Agent for Fivetran Connector SDK

This folder is designed to help you use Cursor with the Fivetran Connector SDK to build custom connectors efficiently.

## Getting started with Cursor

1. Download and Install Cursor - Visit [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh) and download for your OS.
2. Start Cursor in this folder - This ensures you have access to all necessary examples and instructions.
3. Use the AGENTS.md file - Copy its contents into Cursor's chat for AI assistance with connector development.
4. Browse connector examples - Check ../../examples/ for connector patterns and implementations.

## Folder structure

```
cursor/
├── AGENTS.md          # AI instructions for Cursor
└── README.md          # This file - instructions for humans

# Examples are located at: ../../examples/
```

## How to use with Cursor

### 1. Initial setup
```bash
# Install Cursor from cursor.sh
# Open this folder in Cursor
cd all_things_ai/ai_agents/cursor
cursor .
```

### 2. Configure AI context
- Copy the contents of `AGENTS.md` into Cursor's chat
- This provides Cursor with Fivetran SDK expertise
- Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to access Cursor's AI chat interface

### 3. Build your connector
Use Cursor's AI features:
- Chat Interface (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`): Ask questions about connector development
- Code Generation (`Cmd/Ctrl + L`): Generate connector code inline
- Compose (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`): Create complete files and implementations
- Terminal Integration: Test connectors directly in Cursor

### 4. Example prompts
Try these with Cursor:
- "Create a connector for <API name> using the Fivetran SDK patterns"
- "Help me implement pagination for my connector"
- "Debug this connector code and fix any issues"
- "Add incremental sync capability to my connector"

## Key features

- No Yield Required: Modern SDK patterns without yield statements
- Complete Solutions: Get connector.py, requirements.txt, and configuration.json
- Best Practices: Automatic implementation of Fivetran coding standards
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error catching and logging
- Enterprise Ready: Production-quality code generation

## Video tutorials

See our [Cursor AI IDE video tutorial](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/tutorials/cursor-ai-video).

## Development workflow

### 1. Planning phase
- Review API documentation
- Design table structure and primary keys
- Plan error handling strategy
- Design state management approach

### 2. Implementation phase
- Use Cursor AI to generate initial connector structure
- Follow Fivetran SDK patterns from ../../examples/
- Test API integration and response handling
- Validate data types and transformations

### 3. Testing phase
- Use Cursor's terminal for connector testing
- Run `fivetran debug --configuration config.json`
- Verify logs and data output
- Test error scenarios

## Best practices checklist

### Before coding
- [ ] API documentation reviewed
- [ ] Schema designed with primary keys
- [ ] Error handling strategy planned
- [ ] Cursor configured with proper context

### During development
- [ ] Following Fivetran SDK patterns
- [ ] Implementing proper error handling
- [ ] Using direct operation calls (no yield)
- [ ] Adding comprehensive logging

### After implementation
- [ ] Tests passing in Cursor terminal
- [ ] Logs verified at appropriate levels
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Configuration template validated

## Common Cursor commands

```bash
# Test your connector
fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json

# Check output
ls -la warehouse.db

# View logs
# Logs appear in terminal during debug run
```
