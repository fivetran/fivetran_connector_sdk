### 3. Testing phase
- Use integrated terminal for connector testing
- Run `fivetran debug --configuration config.json`
- Share testing results with team in real-time
- Debug collaboratively using shared environment

## Cloud development best practices

### 1. Collaboration
- Use clear commit messages for team transparency
- Structure code in modular functions for easy collaboration
- Add comprehensive comments for team understanding
- Use shared configuration for consistent development

### 2. Performance
- Minimize large file operations in cloud environment
- Use efficient data processing patterns
- Implement proper error handling for network issues
- Test with various network conditions

### 3. Security
- Never commit sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow cloud security best practices
- Implement proper authentication handling

## Example prompts for Windsurf AI

Try these with Windsurf's AI assistant:
- "Create a connector for <API name> using Fivetran SDK patterns"
- "Help me implement pagination with error handling"
- "Generate a complete connector with proper logging"
- "Debug this API integration and fix network issues"
- "Add incremental sync capability to my connector"

## Testing your connector

```bash
# In Windsurf terminal
fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json

# Check output
ls -la warehouse.db

# View logs (appear in terminal during debug run)
```
