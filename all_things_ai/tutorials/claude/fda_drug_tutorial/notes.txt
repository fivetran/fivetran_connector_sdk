Authentication
An API key is required to make calls to the openFDA API. The key is free of charge. Your use of the API may be subject to certain limitations on access, calls, or use. These limitations are designed to manage load on the system, promote equitable access, and prevent abuse. Here are openFDA's standard limits:

With no API key: 240 requests per minute, per IP address. 1,000 requests per day, per IP address.

With an API key: 240 requests per minute, per key. 120,000 requests per day, per key.

If you anticipate usage above the limits provided by an API key, please contact us. We’ll work with you to figure out a good solution to your requirements. Signing up for an API key means you agree to our terms of service.

 Get your API key
Using your API key
Your API key should be passed to the API as the value of the api_key parameter. Include it before other parameters, such as the search parameter. For example:

https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?api_key=yourAPIKeyHere&search=...

HTTPS requests only
Alternatively your API key may be provided as a basic auth username. For example:

Authorization: Basic eW91ckFQSUtleUhlcmU6

openFDA requires you to use https://api.fda.gov for all queries to ensure secure communication.

How to use the API
Getting started with and learning how to use the API is relatively straightforward. Here are some recommended steps:

1
If you haven't already, read the API Basics documentation.
2
Review the list of searchable fields available in the Drug NDC dataset.
3
Try out the Drug NDC endpoint using the interactive examples and tools below.
Then, when you are ready, obtain an API Key. While you don’t need an Application Programming Interface Key to try or use the Application Programming Interface, we recommend you get one if you are planning to use the Application Programming Interface on a regular basis. For more information on Application Programming Interface Keys, see the Authentication documentation.

Making a simple API Call
You can call the API from a web browser. Simply type a valid query in your browser’s address bar and press the Enter key.

In the example below, we are searching the records in the drug NDC Directory endpoint for matches with Class III in the classification field. We are requesting to see the first 5 records that match."

Some key pointers
An openFDA query always begins with the base endpoint, which in this case is: https://api.fda.gov/drug/ndc.json
Searches have a special syntax: search=field:term
Unless otherwise specified, the API will return only one matching record for a search. You can specify the number of records to be returned by using the limit parameter. The maximum limit allowed is 100 for any single Application Programming Interface call. If no limit is set, the Application Programming Interface will return one matching record.
It is possible to construct very complex queries using the openFDA API. Review the Construct the query documentation to learn more about all the available query parameters, how to handle quotations, spaces, phrase matches, and groupings, how to search on dates and ranges, and more.

Example drug NDC queries
To help get you started, we have provided some query examples below. Use the Run query button to call the API and get back results. You can experiment by editing the example queries in the black text box.

Example query

One product
This query searches for all finished products, and asks for a single one.

See the searchable fields for more about finished.

Search for all products which have finished set to true.

Limit to 1 record.

Example query

One lotion product
This query searches all lotion products, and returns a single product.

Double quotation marks " " surround phrases that must match exactly.

Search for all products which have dosage_form equal to 'LOTION'.

Limit to 1 record.

https://api.fda.gov/drug/ndc.json?search=dosage_form:"LOTION"&limit=1
Run query


Example query

Count of pharm classes
This query searches the endpoint for all products, and tells the API to count how many included each pharm_class.

The suffix .exact is required by openFDA to count the unique full phrases in the field voluntary_mandated. Without it, the API will count each word in that field individually.

Count the field pharm_class.
