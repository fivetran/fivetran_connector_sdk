# Databricks FDA Drug Label Intelligence Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs drug labeling data (package inserts) from the [OpenFDA Drug Labeling API](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/label/) and enriches each label with AI-powered analysis using the Databricks [ai_query()](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/ai-functions.html) SQL function during ingestion. Optionally, the connector creates a [Genie Space](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html) on the enriched data so analysts can query drug label intelligence in natural language.

The connector demonstrates the full Fivetran data lifecycle on Databricks:

- MOVE: Fetch drug labels from the free OpenFDA API into Databricks via Fivetran
- TRANSFORM: Enrich each label with AI analysis via `ai_query()` running on the SQL Warehouse
- AGENT: Create a Genie Space with pharma-specific instructions and sample questions

AI enrichment uses `ai_query()` through the Databricks SQL Statement Execution API, which runs on the SQL Warehouse. This avoids the need for a separate Foundation Model serving endpoint and works with any PAT that has SQL execution permissions. The default model is `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6`.

Enrichments include drug interaction risk classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), plain-English contraindication summaries, black box warning detection and summarization, patient-friendly drug descriptions, and AI-classified therapeutic categories.

This is the first Databricks AI tutorial connector in the Fivetran SDK repository, designed for healthcare and BioPharma analytics use cases.

- Data-only mode when `enable_enrichment` is set to `false` for syncing labels without AI enrichment
- Batch processing with per-batch checkpointing for reliable resumable syncs
- Exponential backoff retry logic for both OpenFDA and Databricks SQL Statement API calls
- Automatic text truncation for long label sections to stay within model token limits

## Configuration file

The `configuration.json` file contains the following parameters:

```json
{
  "databricks_workspace_url": "<DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_URL>",
  "databricks_token": "<DATABRICKS_PAT_TOKEN>",
  "databricks_warehouse_id": "<DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID>",

  "max_enrichments": "<MAX_ENRICHMENTS_PER_SYNC>",
  "databricks_timeout": "<DATABRICKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS>"
}
```

- `databricks_workspace_url` (required when enrichment or Genie enabled): Full Databricks workspace URL including `https://` (e.g., `https://dbc-xxxxx.cloud.databricks.com`)
- `databricks_token` (required when enrichment or Genie enabled): Databricks Personal Access Token with SQL execution permissions
- `databricks_warehouse_id` (required when enrichment or Genie enabled): SQL Warehouse ID to execute `ai_query()` statements and create Genie Spaces
- `databricks_model` (optional): Databricks Foundation Model name for `ai_query()`. Default: `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `enable_enrichment` (optional): Set to `false` to sync drug labels without AI enrichment. Default: `true`
- `enable_genie_space` (optional): Set to `true` to create a Genie Space on the enriched data after sync. Default: `false`
- `genie_table_identifier` (required when Genie enabled): Unity Catalog table path for the Genie Space data source (format: `catalog.schema.table`)
- `max_labels` (optional): Maximum number of drug labels to sync per run. Default: `25`. Maximum: `500`
- `batch_size` (optional): Number of labels to process per batch before checkpointing. Default: `5`

- `databricks_timeout` (optional): Timeout in seconds for Databricks SQL Statement API calls. Default: `120`

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

The OpenFDA Drug Labeling API is free and requires no authentication.

Databricks access requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with SQL execution permissions:

1. Navigate to your Databricks workspace
2. Click your username in the top-right corner and select **Settings**
3. Click **Developer** in the left panel
4. Click **Manage** next to **Access tokens**
5. Click **Generate new token**, provide a description, and click **Generate**
6. Copy the token value and set it as `databricks_token` in your `configuration.json`

The PAT must have permissions to execute SQL statements on the specified SQL Warehouse. The `ai_query()` function is available on Databricks SQL Warehouses with Foundation Model APIs enabled.

## Pagination

The connector uses offset-based pagination with the OpenFDA API. Each sync fetches labels in batches controlled by the `batch_size` parameter (default: 5). The connector tracks progress via the `skip` parameter and checkpoints state after each batch so that interrupted syncs resume from the last completed batch rather than restarting.

## Data handling

The `def update(configuration, state)` function orchestrates a three-phase sync pipeline:

Phase 1 (MOVE):
1. Validates configuration via `def validate_configuration(configuration)` including Databricks credential checks when enrichment or Genie Space creation is enabled
2. Builds an incremental date filter from the saved `last_effective_time` state cursor
3. Fetches drug labels page by page from the OpenFDA API via `def fetch_labels_page(session, skip, limit, effective_date_filter)`

Phase 2 (TRANSFORM):
4. For each label, builds a normalized record via `def build_label_record(label, label_id)` extracting brand name, generic name, manufacturer, route, substance, and clinical section indicators
5. If enrichment is enabled and within the enrichment budget, extracts clinical text sections via `def extract_label_text_sections(label)` and calls `ai_query()` via `def enrich_drug_label(session, configuration, sections)` for AI analysis
6. Flattens any nested structures via `def flatten_dict(d, parent_key, sep)` and upserts to the destination table
7. Checkpoints state after each batch with the latest effective time cursor

Phase 3 (AGENT):
8. If Genie Space creation is enabled and data was synced, creates a Genie Space via `def create_genie_space(session, configuration, state)` with pharma-specific instructions and sample questions pointed at the destination table

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling at multiple levels:

- `def fetch_data_with_retry(session, url, params, headers)` provides exponential backoff retry logic for transient API failures (HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) with immediate failure on authentication errors (401, 403)
- `def call_ai_query(session, configuration, prompt)` catches specific exception types (Timeout, HTTPError, ConnectionError, RequestException, JSONDecodeError) and returns None on failure, allowing the sync to continue with unenriched records
- `def create_genie_space(session, configuration, state)` catches HTTP and request errors and logs warnings without failing the sync, since data has already landed successfully
- `def validate_configuration(configuration)` validates all required parameters upfront using `def _is_placeholder(value)` to detect uncommitted placeholder values
- Sanity ceilings enforce maximum values for `max_labels` (500) and `max_enrichments` (500) to prevent runaway costs
- The session is always closed via a try/finally block in `def update(configuration, state)` to release resources even on unexpected errors

## Tables created

### DRUG_LABELS_ENRICHED

The `DRUG_LABELS_ENRICHED` table consists of the following columns:

- `label_id` (STRING, primary key): Unique identifier composed of set_id and version (e.g., `abc123_1`)
- `set_id` (STRING): FDA-assigned set identifier for the drug label
- `version` (STRING): Label version number
- `effective_time` (STRING): Date the label became effective (YYYYMMDD format)
- `brand_name` (STRING): Brand name of the drug (e.g., "Lipitor")
- `generic_name` (STRING): Generic chemical name (e.g., "atorvastatin calcium")
- `manufacturer_name` (STRING): Name of the drug manufacturer
- `product_type` (STRING): FDA product type classification
- `route` (STRING): JSON array of administration routes (e.g., oral, intravenous)
- `substance_name` (STRING): JSON array of active substance names
- `rxcui` (STRING): JSON array of RxNorm concept unique identifiers
- `spl_id` (STRING): Structured Product Labeling identifier
- `application_number` (STRING): FDA application number (NDA/ANDA/BLA)
- `pharm_class_epc` (STRING): JSON array of established pharmacologic class
- `has_drug_interactions` (BOOLEAN): Whether the label contains a drug interactions section
- `has_contraindications` (BOOLEAN): Whether the label contains a contraindications section
- `has_boxed_warning` (BOOLEAN): Whether the label contains a boxed (black box) warning section
- `has_warnings` (BOOLEAN): Whether the label contains a warnings section
- `interaction_risk_level` (STRING): AI-classified drug interaction risk level (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW). Populated when enrichment is enabled
- `contraindication_summary` (STRING): AI-generated plain-English summary of key contraindications. Populated when enrichment is enabled
- `has_black_box_warning` (BOOLEAN): AI-determined presence of a boxed warning based on label text analysis. Populated when enrichment is enabled
- `black_box_summary` (STRING): AI-generated summary of the boxed warning content. Populated when enrichment is enabled
- `patient_friendly_description` (STRING): AI-generated patient-friendly description of what the drug does and what it treats. Populated when enrichment is enabled
- `therapeutic_category` (STRING): AI-classified therapeutic category (e.g., Cardiovascular, Oncology, Neurology). Populated when enrichment is enabled
- `enrichment_model` (STRING): Name of the Databricks Foundation Model used for enrichment

## Genie Space

When `enable_genie_space` is set to `true`, the connector creates a Databricks Genie Space after data lands. The Genie Space is configured with:

- Pharma-specific instructions that guide the Genie agent to prioritize patient safety insights and use the AI enrichment fields for filtering
- Five sample questions including "Which drugs have HIGH interaction risk and a black box warning?" and "Show me all cardiovascular drugs sorted by interaction risk level"
- A pointer to the destination table specified in `genie_table_identifier`

The Genie Space is created only once. The `space_id` is persisted in the connector state to avoid creating duplicates on subsequent syncs.

Note: The `genie_table_identifier` must be a fully qualified Unity Catalog path (e.g., `my_catalog.my_schema.drug_labels_enriched`). The table must exist in the Databricks workspace before the Genie Space can query it, so the Genie Space is most useful after at least one successful sync with `fivetran deploy`.

## Additional considerations

This example was contributed by [Kelly Kohlleffel](https://github.com/kellykohlleffel).

This is the first Databricks AI tutorial connector in the Fivetran SDK repository. It uses `ai_query()` through the SQL Statement Execution API rather than a dedicated model serving endpoint, which simplifies setup and works with standard SQL Warehouse permissions. The optional Genie Space creation demonstrates the full Move, Transform, Agent data lifecycle within a single connector.

The OpenFDA API is free and does not require authentication. Rate limits apply (240 requests per minute without an API key, higher with a key). The connector includes rate limiting delays between requests to stay within these limits.

Databricks `ai_query()` consumes SQL Warehouse compute credits. Costs vary by model and token usage. Use the `max_enrichments` parameter to control costs during development and testing. Set `enable_enrichment` to `false` to test the data pipeline without incurring compute costs.
