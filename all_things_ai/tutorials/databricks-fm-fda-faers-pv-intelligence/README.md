# Databricks FDA FAERS Pharmacovigilance Intelligence Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs adverse event reports from the [FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/) via the OpenFDA Drug Event API and enriches each serious event with AI-powered multi-agent debate analysis using the Databricks [ai_query()](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/ai-functions.html) SQL function. Two AI personas with opposing pharmacovigilance perspectives analyze each event, then a consensus agent synthesizes both views and flags disagreements for human PV review.

This connector pairs with the FDA Drug Label Intelligence connector (PR #567) to provide a complete drug safety pipeline on Databricks: labels for drug information + adverse events for post-market surveillance.

Two-phase architecture:

- Phase 1 (MOVE): Fetch adverse event reports from the OpenFDA Drug Event API, optionally filtered by drug name
- Phase 2 (DEBATE): For each serious event, three ai_query() calls produce competing analyses:
  1. Safety Advocate: risk-maximizing pharmacovigilance perspective, flags potential safety signals
  2. Clinical Realist: context-aware clinical perspective, considers patient demographics and concomitant medications
  3. Consensus Agent: synthesizes both, produces disagreement_flag and debate_winner

The disagreement_flag identifies adverse events where the two experts significantly disagree on whether the event represents a real safety signal, flagging them for human pharmacovigilance review.

Optional [Genie Space](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html) creation after data lands for natural language analytics.

- Multi-Agent Debate: Safety Advocate vs Clinical Realist with consensus synthesizer
- Disagreement flag identifies events where experts disagree on safety signal validity
- Debate winner field shows which expert was more persuasive for each event
- Drug-specific filtering via `search_drug` parameter (e.g., "lipitor", "aspirin")
- AI enrichment via Databricks `ai_query()` SQL function using Claude Sonnet 4.6 (configurable model)
- Optional Genie Space creation with pharmacovigilance-specific instructions and sample questions
- Incremental sync using receive date as a cursor
- Configurable enrichment budget via `max_enrichments` (3x ai_query calls per event)
- Data-only mode when `enable_enrichment` is set to `false`
- Per-event checkpointing for reliable resumable syncs during the debate phase
- Async polling for long-running ai_query() statements

## Configuration file

The `configuration.json` file contains the following parameters:

```json
{
  "databricks_workspace_url": "<DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_URL>",
  "databricks_token": "<DATABRICKS_PAT_TOKEN>",
  "databricks_warehouse_id": "<DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID>",
  "databricks_model": "<DATABRICKS_MODEL_NAME>",
  "enable_enrichment": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>",
  "enable_genie_space": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>",
  "genie_table_identifier": "<CATALOG.SCHEMA.TABLE>",
  "search_drug": "<DRUG_NAME_OR_EMPTY>",
  "max_events": "<MAX_EVENTS_PER_SYNC>",
  "max_enrichments": "<MAX_ENRICHMENTS_PER_SYNC>",
  "lookback_days": "<LOOKBACK_DAYS>",
  "databricks_timeout": "<DATABRICKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS>"
}
```

- `databricks_workspace_url` (required when enrichment or Genie enabled): Full Databricks workspace URL including `https://`
- `databricks_token` (required when enrichment or Genie enabled): Databricks Personal Access Token with SQL execution permissions
- `databricks_warehouse_id` (required when enrichment or Genie enabled): SQL Warehouse ID for `ai_query()` execution
- `databricks_model` (optional): Databricks Foundation Model name. Default: `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `enable_enrichment` (optional): Set to `false` to sync events without AI debate. Default: `true`
- `enable_genie_space` (optional): Set to `true` to create a Genie Space after sync. Default: `false`
- `genie_table_identifier` (required when Genie enabled): Unity Catalog table path (format: `catalog.schema.table`)
- `search_drug` (optional): Drug name to filter adverse events (e.g., "lipitor", "aspirin"). Omit to fetch all events
- `max_events` (optional): Maximum events to sync per run. Default: `10`. Maximum: `100`
- `max_enrichments` (optional): Maximum events to run through debate (3 ai_query calls each). Default: `5`. Maximum: `50`
- `lookback_days` (optional): Days to look back on initial sync. Default: `30`
- `databricks_timeout` (optional): Timeout in seconds for Databricks API calls. Default: `120`

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

The OpenFDA Drug Event API is free and requires no authentication. An optional API key provides higher rate limits (120K requests/day vs 240/minute without key).

Databricks access requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with SQL execution permissions:

1. Navigate to your Databricks workspace
2. Click your username in the top-right corner and select **Settings**
3. Click **Developer** in the left panel
4. Click **Manage** next to **Access tokens**
5. Click **Generate new token**, provide a description, and click **Generate**
6. Copy the token value and set it as `databricks_token` in your `configuration.json`

## Pagination

The OpenFDA Drug Event API supports offset-based pagination via `skip` and `limit` parameters (max 100 per page). The connector fetches up to `max_events` records per sync and uses the `receivedate` field as an incremental cursor for subsequent syncs. The search URL is built manually to avoid requests percent-encoding the Lucene query syntax brackets and plus signs.

## Data handling

The `def update(configuration, state)` function orchestrates a three-phase sync pipeline:

Phase 1 (MOVE):
1. Validates configuration via `def validate_configuration(configuration)`
2. Builds a Lucene search query from the `last_receive_date` state cursor (or `lookback_days` for initial sync) and optional `search_drug` filter
3. Fetches adverse events via `def fetch_adverse_events(session, search_query, limit, skip)` with manual URL construction to preserve Lucene syntax
4. Builds normalized records via `def build_event_record(event)` extracting primary drug, primary reaction, patient demographics, seriousness indicators, and full drug/reaction lists
5. Upserts records and checkpoints with the latest receive date

Phase 2 (DEBATE):
6. Filters to serious events only for debate (events where `serious = "1"`)
7. For each serious event, runs three ai_query() calls via `def run_multi_agent_debate(session, configuration, events, event_records, state)`:
   - `def build_safety_prompt(event_record)` for the Safety Advocate (signal detection, escalation recommendation)
   - `def build_clinical_prompt(event_record)` for the Clinical Realist (causality assessment, clinical context)
   - `def build_consensus_prompt(event_record, safety_result, clinical_result)` for synthesis
8. Checkpoints after each event is debated

Phase 3 (AGENT):
9. If enabled, creates a Genie Space via `def create_genie_space(session, configuration, state)`

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling at multiple levels:

- `def fetch_data_with_retry(session, url, params)` provides exponential backoff retry logic for transient API failures with immediate failure on access errors
- `def call_ai_query(session, configuration, prompt)` catches specific exception types and returns None on failure, with async polling for PENDING/RUNNING SQL statements
- Individual debate agent failures are handled gracefully: if either analyst returns None, the consensus step is skipped for that event
- `def validate_configuration(configuration)` validates all required parameters using `def _is_placeholder(value)`
- Sanity ceilings enforce maximum values for `max_events` (100) and `max_enrichments` (50)
- The session is always closed via a try/finally block

## Genie Space

When `enable_genie_space` is set to `true`, the connector creates a Databricks Genie Space after data lands. The Genie Space is configured with pharmacovigilance-specific instructions and sample questions including "Which adverse events have disagreement flags needing PV review?" and "What drugs have the most serious adverse events?"

The Genie Space is created only once. The `space_id` is persisted in the connector state to avoid creating duplicates on subsequent syncs.

## Additional considerations

This example was contributed by [Kelly Kohlleffel](https://github.com/kellykohlleffel).

This connector pairs with the FDA Drug Label Intelligence connector (PR #567) to provide a complete drug safety pipeline on Databricks. Drug labels provide the reference data (interactions, contraindications, black box warnings) while FAERS adverse events provide post-market surveillance data. Together they map directly to the Databricks BioPharma outcome "Pharmacovigilance (Drug Safety and Adverse Event Detection)."

The OpenFDA Drug Event API is free and requires no authentication. Rate limits apply (240 requests per minute without key). The connector includes rate limiting delays between requests.

Databricks `ai_query()` consumes SQL Warehouse compute credits. The debate pattern makes 3 ai_query() calls per serious event. Use `max_enrichments` to control costs. Set `enable_enrichment` to `false` for data-only mode.
