# FHIR R4 Healthcare Intelligence Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs clinical data from a FHIR R4 server and enriches it with AI-powered hybrid analysis using Databricks `ai_query()`. It implements the Hybrid pattern (Discovery + Debate) to provide population health risk stratification and per-patient intervention recommendations.

The connector fetches Patient, Condition, Observation, and MedicationRequest resources from any FHIR R4-compliant server, then applies two AI enrichment phases: a Discovery phase that analyzes the patient cohort to identify at-risk populations, and a Debate phase where a Clinical Risk Analyst and a Resource Allocation Analyst debate intervention priorities for each patient, producing a consensus intervention level with a disagreement flag. An optional Genie Space can be created in Databricks for natural language clinical analytics.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)
- Databricks workspace with a SQL warehouse and Foundation Model API access (required if AI enrichment is enabled)
- Access to a FHIR R4 server (default: HAPI FHIR public test server, no credentials required)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Fetches Patient, Condition, Observation, and MedicationRequest resources from any FHIR R4-compliant server
- Supports optional ICD-10 code prefix filtering to target a specific patient cohort (e.g., `E11` for diabetes)
- Supports incremental sync using FHIR `_lastUpdated` filtering based on the previous sync timestamp
- Discovery phase: calls Databricks `ai_query()` to identify at-risk populations, dominant conditions, and recommended screenings across the cohort
- Debate phase: for each patient, a Clinical Risk Analyst and a Resource Allocation Analyst independently assess the patient, then a Consensus Agent synthesizes a final intervention level with a disagreement flag
- Produces eight destination tables: four FHIR resource tables and four AI enrichment tables
- Optional Genie Space creation in Databricks for natural language clinical analytics

## Configuration file

The `configuration.json` file holds the connection parameters. Copy the template and fill in your values.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

| Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| fhir_base_url | Base URL of the FHIR R4 server | No | https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4 |

| databricks_token | Databricks Personal Access Token | Yes (if enrichment enabled) | None |

## Authentication

The FHIR R4 data source uses no authentication by default. The HAPI FHIR public test server (`https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4`) is an open server that requires no credentials. If you configure a private FHIR server that requires authentication, add the appropriate authorization header to the session in `connector.py`.

Databricks authentication uses a Personal Access Token (PAT). Generate a PAT from your Databricks workspace under **Settings** > **Developer** > **Access tokens**, then set it as the `databricks_token` configuration value. The token is passed as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header for all Databricks SQL Statement API calls.

## Pagination

FHIR R4 servers return resources as paginated Bundle resources. The connector follows `Bundle.link` entries with `relation=next` to retrieve subsequent pages until no next link is present or the configured `max_patients` limit is reached. The next-page URL is used directly as provided by the server; query parameters are only passed on the initial request.

Databricks SQL Statement API results may be paginated via `next_chunk_internal_link`. The connector follows these links to retrieve all rows from large `ai_query()` results.

## Data handling

FHIR resources use deeply nested JSON structures (CodeableConcept, Reference, Quantity, HumanName). The connector normalizes these using dedicated extraction helpers:

- `extract_codeable_concept()` — extracts the first code and display text from a CodeableConcept
- `extract_reference_id()` — extracts the resource ID from a FHIR Reference string
- `extract_quantity()` — extracts the numeric value and unit from a Quantity

All remaining nested dictionaries are flattened using `flatten_dict()` before upsert. Arrays and lists are serialized to JSON strings. AI enrichment fields that return JSON arrays (e.g., `dominant_conditions`, `immediate_actions`) are stored as JSON strings in the destination.

## Error handling

FHIR API requests are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff for status codes 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504. Authentication errors (401, 403) are not retried and raise an immediate error with a credential check message.

Databricks `ai_query()` failures are handled gracefully: if an enrichment call fails or times out, that patient's assessment is skipped and a warning is logged, but the sync continues. Checkpoints are written after each patient debate and after each enrichment phase so that progress is not lost if a sync is interrupted.

The connector creates the following tables in the destination.

## Additional considerations

This connector was built by David Millman (david.millman@fivetran.com) during a working session with Kelly Kohlleffel. It follows the Hybrid (Discovery + Debate) pattern established by the NOAA Weather Risk Intelligence connector (PR #570) and the FDA FAERS Pharmacovigilance Intelligence connector (PR #571). The HAPI FHIR public test server (`https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4`) is used as the default data source and contains synthetic clinical data suitable for demonstration purposes.
