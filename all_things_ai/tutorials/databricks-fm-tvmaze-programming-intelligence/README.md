# Databricks TVMaze Programming Intelligence Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs TV show metadata from the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) and enriches each show with AI-powered multi-agent debate using the Databricks [ai_query()](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/ai-functions.html) SQL function.

A Programming Optimist and a Programming Skeptic each argue their case for a show's renewal probability. A Consensus agent synthesizes both perspectives into a `renewal_rating` and sets a `disagreement_flag` when the analysts meaningfully disagree — flagging shows for human programming team review.

The `disagreement_flag` is the product: pre-computed analyst contention surfaces the shows that warrant human judgment, without requiring dashboards or scheduled jobs.

Optional [Genie Space](https://docs.databricks.com/en/genie/index.html) creation after data lands enables natural language programming analytics.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)
- A Databricks workspace with a SQL Warehouse that supports `ai_query()` (required for AI enrichment; optional for data-only mode)
- A Databricks Personal Access Token (PAT) with SQL execution permissions

Note: The TVMaze API requires no authentication or API key.

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Syncs TV show metadata from the TVMaze public catalog (~70,000 shows)
- Initial sync paginates `/shows?page=N` with configurable page cap and per-page checkpointing for safe resume
- Incremental sync uses `/updates/shows?since=week` as a cursor, fetching only shows updated since the last sync
- AI enrichment via Databricks `ai_query()` with a three-agent Multi-Agent Debate: Programming Optimist, Programming Skeptic, and Consensus
- `disagreement_flag` surfaces shows where the two analysts meaningfully disagree for human review queues
- Optional genre and status filtering to scope syncs to relevant shows
- Optional Genie Space creation with programming-analytics instructions and sample questions
- Configurable enrichment budget via `max_enrichments` to control costs
- Data-only mode when `enable_enrichment` is set to `false`
- Async polling for long-running `ai_query()` statements with PENDING/RUNNING state handling

## Configuration file

The `configuration.json` file contains the following parameters:

```json
{
  "databricks_workspace_url": "<DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_URL>",
  "databricks_token": "<DATABRICKS_PAT_TOKEN>",
  "databricks_warehouse_id": "<DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID>",
  "databricks_model": "<DATABRICKS_MODEL_NAME>",
  "enable_enrichment": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>",
  "enable_genie_space": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>",
  "genie_table_identifier": "<CATALOG.SCHEMA.TABLE>",
  "initial_sync_max_pages": "<MAX_PAGES_FOR_INITIAL_SYNC>",
  "max_enrichments": "<MAX_ENRICHMENTS_PER_SYNC>",
  "genre_filter": "<OPTIONAL_GENRE_FILTER>",
  "status_filter": "<OPTIONAL_STATUS_FILTER>",
  "databricks_timeout": "<DATABRICKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS>"
}
```

- `databricks_workspace_url` (required): Full Databricks workspace URL including `https://`
- `databricks_token` (required): Databricks Personal Access Token with SQL execution permissions
- `databricks_warehouse_id` (required): SQL Warehouse ID for `ai_query()` execution
- `databricks_model` (optional): Databricks Foundation Model name. Default: `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `enable_enrichment` (optional): Set to `false` for data-only mode. Default: `false`
- `enable_genie_space` (optional): Set to `true` to create a Genie Space after sync. Default: `false`
- `genie_table_identifier` (required when Genie enabled): Unity Catalog table path in `catalog.schema.table` format
- `initial_sync_max_pages` (optional): Maximum pages to fetch per sync run during initial load. Default: `10`. Maximum: `300`. Each page returns approximately 250 shows.
- `max_enrichments` (optional): Maximum `ai_query()` calls per sync. Default: `50`. Maximum: `500`
- `genre_filter` (optional): Comma-separated genre filter, for example `Drama,Crime`. Leave empty to sync all genres.
- `status_filter` (optional): Filter by show status: `Running`, `Ended`, `To Be Determined`, or `In Development`. Leave empty to sync all statuses.
- `databricks_timeout` (optional): Databricks SQL query timeout in seconds. Default: `120`

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

The TVMaze API is public and requires no authentication or API key.

Databricks access requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with SQL execution permissions:

1. Navigate to your Databricks workspace
2. Click your username in the top-right corner and select **Settings**
3. Click **Developer** in the left panel
4. Click **Manage** next to **Access tokens**
5. Click **Generate new token**, provide a description, and click **Generate**
6. Copy the token value and set it as `databricks_token` in your `configuration.json`

## Pagination

The TVMaze API uses page-based pagination for the initial catalog sync. The connector fetches pages via `GET /shows?page=N`, where each page returns approximately 250 shows. Pagination ends when the API returns HTTP 404. The `initial_sync_max_pages` parameter caps the number of pages fetched per sync run, enabling safe multi-run initial loads with per-page checkpointing.

For incremental syncs, the connector calls `GET /updates/shows?since=week` to retrieve a map of show IDs updated in the past week, then filters to shows updated after the stored `last_updates_poll` timestamp.

## Data handling

The `def update(configuration, state)` function orchestrates the sync in three phases:

1. Validates configuration via `def validate_configuration(configuration)` including Databricks credential checks and sanity ceilings on configurable limits
2. Phase 1 - MOVE: Fetches shows from the TVMaze API via `def fetch_data_with_retry(session, url, params)`, normalizes nested structures via `def flatten_show(show)`, and upserts records with per-page checkpointing
3. Phase 2 - DEBATE: For each show in the current sync batch (up to `max_enrichments`), fetches embedded cast and episode data, builds a context string via `def build_show_context(show, embedded)`, and runs three `ai_query()` calls via `def run_debate(databricks_session, configuration, show_record, embedded, state)`: Programming Optimist, Programming Skeptic, and Consensus
4. Phase 3 - AGENT: Optionally creates a Genie Space via `def create_genie_space(databricks_session, configuration, state)` with programming-analytics instructions and sample questions

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling at multiple levels:

- `def fetch_data_with_retry(session, url, params)` provides exponential backoff for transient failures (429, 500-504) with immediate failure on auth errors (401, 403) and None return on HTTP 404 to signal end of pagination
- `def call_ai_query(session, configuration, prompt)` catches specific exception types (`Timeout`, `HTTPError`, `ConnectionError`, `RequestException`, `JSONDecodeError`) and returns None on failure, with async polling for PENDING and RUNNING states up to `__SQL_MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS`
- `def _extract_json(raw)` strips markdown code fences from model responses before JSON parsing
- `def validate_configuration(configuration)` validates all parameters using `def _is_placeholder(value)` with sanity ceilings of 300 pages and 500 enrichments
- Both TVMaze and Databricks sessions are always closed via a try/finally block

Databricks `ai_query()` consumes SQL Warehouse compute credits. Use `max_enrichments` to control costs. Set `enable_enrichment` to `false` for data-only mode.

The TVMaze API rate limit is 20 requests per 10 seconds. The connector includes rate limiting delays between individual show fetches during incremental sync and enrichment pre-fetch.
