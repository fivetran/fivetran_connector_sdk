## Configuration file

The connector requires minimal configuration with only essential connection parameters:

```json
{
"mssql_server": "<YOUR_SQL_SERVER_HOST_NAME>",
"mssql_database": "<YOUR_SQL_SERVER_DATABASE>",
"mssql_user": "<YOUR_SQL_SERVER_DATABASE_USER>",
"mssql_password": "<YOUR_SQL_SERVER_USER_PASSWORD>",
"mssql_port": "<YOUR_SQL_SERVER_PORT>"
}
```

### Configuration parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required | Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `mssql_server` | SQL Server hostname or IP address | Yes | `server.company.com` |
| `mssql_database` | Database name to connect to | Yes | `SalesDB` |
| `mssql_user` | Database username | Yes | `fivetran_user` |
| `mssql_password` | Database password | Yes | `secure_password` |
| `mssql_port` | SQL Server port (default: 1433) | Yes | `1433` |

NOTE: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector:

```
pytds==1.9.2
```

NOTE: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector uses SQL Server authentication with username and password credentials. Ensure your database user has the following permissions:

* SELECT permissions on all tables you want to replicate
* Access to INFORMATION_SCHEMA views for schema discovery
* Network connectivity to the SQL Server instance

IMPORTANT: For production use, consider implementing Windows Authentication or Azure Active Directory authentication for enhanced security.

## Pagination

The connector implements batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently. Data is fetched in configurable batches (default: 1,000 records) to optimize memory usage and processing performance.

**Batch processing strategy:**
- Configurable batch size via `BATCH_SIZE` constant
- Automatic checkpointing every 5,000 records
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets

## Data handling

The connector automatically discovers and maps data from SQL Server to Fivetran with the following characteristics:

**Schema discovery process:**
1. Queries INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES to identify available tables
2. Discovers primary keys from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
3. Maps column names and data types from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
4. Creates table definitions with primary key information

**Data synchronization:**
- Full load for initial sync or when no previous state exists
- Incremental sync using timestamp-based filtering (ModifiedDate column)
- Automatic fallback to full load if incremental sync fails
- State management for tracking sync progress

**Data transformation:**
- Automatic flattening of nested data structures
- Null value handling and data type preservation
- Column name mapping and validation

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies:

**Connection errors** - Refer to `connect_to_mssql()` function
- Graceful handling of database connection failures
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

**Query errors** - Refer to `get_table_data()` function
- Fallback from incremental to full load on query failures
- Exception handling for malformed queries
- Logging of specific error details for debugging

**Data processing errors** - Refer to lines 280-290 in `update()` function
- Individual record error handling without stopping entire sync
- Warning logging for failed record processing
- Continuation of processing for remaining records

**State management errors** - Refer to `op.checkpoint()` calls
- Safe checkpointing with error recovery
- State validation and consistency checks
- Automatic state recovery mechanisms

## Tables created

The connector creates the following tables in your destination:

**Replicated tables** - One table per source table discovered
- Automatically named to match source table names
- Includes all columns from source tables
- Primary keys preserved for data integrity

**SYNC_VALIDATION table** - Contains sync metadata
- `sync_timestamp` - Timestamp of sync completion
- `total_tables` - Number of tables processed
- `total_records` - Total records synchronized
- `tables_processed` - Comma-separated list of processed tables

## Additional considerations

### Performance optimization

The connector includes several performance optimization features:

**Batch processing** - Refer to `BATCH_SIZE` constant
- Configurable batch size for optimal memory usage
- Automatic checkpointing to prevent data loss
- Efficient data streaming for large datasets
