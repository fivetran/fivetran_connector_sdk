"""
Simple MSSQL Connector Example for Fivetran Connector SDK

This connector demonstrates how to fetch data from Microsoft SQL Server and upsert it into destination 
using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It includes hardcoded queries, minimal configuration, and follows 
best practices for easy adoption.

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Reduces data pipeline development time from weeks to hours
- Eliminates manual data extraction and transformation tasks
- Provides real-time data synchronization for business intelligence
- Scales from small datasets to enterprise-level data volumes
- Reduces data engineering maintenance overhead

FEATURES:
- Hardcoded SQL queries (no configuration complexity)
- Limited to 10 tables for demonstration
- Simple incremental sync with state management
- Proper error handling and logging
- Follows Fivetran best practices

UPGRADE PATH FOR THE ENTERPRISE:
This simple connector can be enhanced* with the following optimizations from {Git_Repo}/EHI_at_scale/connector.py:
1. Adaptive Processing: Automatically adjust batch sizes based on table size
2. Resource Monitoring: Monitor CPU/memory usage and adjust processing
3. Connection Management: Handle timeouts and deadlocks gracefully
4. Table Categorization: Process small/medium/large tables optimally
5. Multi-threading: Parallel processing for large datasets
6. Advanced Error Recovery: Retry logic with exponential backoff
7. Performance Metrics: Detailed monitoring and validation
