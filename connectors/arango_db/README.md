# ArangoDB Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to sync data from ArangoDB, a native multi-model database that combines document, graph, and key-value capabilities.

The connector syncs three collections from a travel dataset: airports (document collection), flights (edge collection for graph relationships), and points-of-interest (document collection). This example showcases ArangoDB's unique multi-model architecture and is ideal for use cases involving interconnected data like social networks, recommendation engines, and travel planning systems.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Syncs document collections (airports, points-of-interest) and edge collections (flights)
- Demonstrates ArangoDB's multi-model capabilities combining documents and graphs
- Implements batch processing with checkpointing for large datasets
- Uses offset-based pagination to handle collections with hundreds of thousands of records
- Preserves ArangoDB's native fields including `_key`, `_from`, and `_to` for graph relationships

## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```
{
  "host": "<YOUR_ARANGODB_HOST>",
  "database": "<YOUR_ARANGODB_DATABASE_NAME>",
  "username": "<YOUR_ARANGODB_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_ARANGODB_PASSWORD>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
The connector requires the `python-arango` package to connect to ArangoDB databases.

```
python-arango
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
This connector uses username and password authentication to connect to ArangoDB. The credentials are specified in the configuration file and passed with the `ArangoClient.db()` method. Refer to the `connect_to_arangodb()` function in `connector.py`.

To set up authentication:

1. Obtain your ArangoDB instance URL (either cloud-hosted or self-hosted).
2. Create a database user with read permissions on the collections you want to sync.
3. Provide the host URL, database name, username, and password in the `configuration.json` file.
4. Ensure the user has `READ` permissions on the collections that need to be synced.

## Pagination
The connector implements offset-based pagination using ArangoDB's `skip` and `limit` parameters. Each collection is synced in batches of 1,000 records (defined by `__CHECKPOINT_BATCH_SIZE`).

The connector tracks the current offset in the state for each collection, allowing it to resume from the correct position after interruptions. Refer to the `sync_collection_batches()` function in `connector.py` for pagination logic details.

## Data handling
The connector processes each ArangoDB collection independently and upserts documents as-is to the destination tables. 

Document collections (airports, points-of-interest) contain standard fields like name, location coordinates, and metadata. Edge collections (flights) include special ArangoDB fields (`_from`, `_to`) that define graph relationships between airports. 

All ArangoDB system fields (`_key`, `_id`, `_rev`) are preserved in the destination for data lineage. The schema definition includes only the primary key (`_key`); Fivetran infers all other columns and data types automatically. Refer to the `schema()` and `sync_collection()` functions in `connector.py` for data handling details.

## Error handling
The connector implements comprehensive error handling with the following strategies:
- Connection failures are caught and logged with detailed error messages before raising a `RuntimeError`
- Collection access errors are caught at the collection level with specific error context
- Each collection is synced independently, so a failure in one collection does not prevent others from syncing successfully
- All errors are logged using the SDK's logging facility with appropriate severity levels

Refer to the `connect_to_arangodb()`, `sync_collection()`, and `update()` functions in `connector.py` for error handling details.

## Tables created
The connector creates the following tables:

| Table Name           | Type                | Primary Key | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AIRPORTS`           | Document Collection | `_key`      | Airport information including name, city, state, country, coordinates (lat, long), and VIP status. All ArangoDB system fields (`_key`, `_id`, `_rev`) are preserved.                                |
| `FLIGHTS`            | Edge Collection     | `_key`      | Flight connections between airports (graph relationships). Includes ArangoDB graph fields (`_from`, `_to`) plus flight details like date, times, carrier, flight number, tail number, and distance. |
| `POINTS_OF_INTEREST` | Document Collection | `_key`      | Travel destination information including title, type, description, coordinates (latitude, longitude), URL, article, contact information (phone, email), and `last_edit` timestamp.                  |
