"""ArangoDB Connector for Fivetran Connector SDK.
This connector demonstrates how to sync data from ArangoDB multi-model database.
It syncs document collections (airports, points-of-interest) and edge collections (flights)
showcasing ArangoDB's native support for documents and graphs.
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details
