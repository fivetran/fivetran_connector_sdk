# AroFlo API Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector synchronizes users, suppliers, and payments data from AroFlo's field service management platform. It demonstrates memory-efficient streaming patterns, comprehensive error handling, and incremental synchronization using the Fivetran Connector SDK. The connector is designed to handle real-world scenarios including API rate limiting, large datasets, and network connectivity issues while maintaining data integrity and sync reliability.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements): **3.9-3.13**
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Syncs user/employee data, supplier information, and payment transactions from AroFlo API
- Bearer token authentication with configurable timeout and retry settings (refer to `execute_api_request` function)
- Page-based pagination with automatic page traversal for large datasets (refer to `get_users_data`, `get_suppliers_data`, and `get_payments_data` functions)
- Memory-efficient streaming prevents data accumulation using generator patterns
- Incremental synchronization using timestamp-based cursors with configurable lookback periods (refer to `get_time_range` function)
- Comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff retry logic and rate limit support (refer to `__handle_rate_limit` and `__handle_request_error` functions)
- Configurable sync options to enable/disable specific data types independently
- Production-ready logging with appropriate log levels for monitoring and debugging

## Configuration file
```json
{
  "api_key": "<YOUR_AROFLO_API_KEY>",
  "sync_frequency_hours": "<SYNC_FREQUENCY_HOURS>",
  "initial_sync_days": "<INITIAL_SYNC_DAYS>",
  "max_records_per_page": "<MAX_RECORDS_PER_PAGE>",
  "request_timeout_seconds": "<REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS>",
  "retry_attempts": "<RETRY_ATTEMPTS>",
  "enable_users_sync": "<ENABLE_USERS_SYNC>",
  "enable_suppliers_sync": "<ENABLE_SUPPLIERS_SYNC>",
  "enable_payments_sync": "<ENABLE_PAYMENTS_SYNC>",
  "enable_incremental_sync": "<ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_SYNC>",
  "enable_debug_logging": "<ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING>"
}
```

### Configuration parameters
- `api_key` (required): Your AroFlo API authentication key
- `sync_frequency_hours` (optional): How often to run incremental syncs, defaults to 4 hours
- `initial_sync_days` (optional): How many days of historical data to fetch on first sync, defaults to 90 days
- `max_records_per_page` (optional): Number of records per API request, defaults to 100 (range: 1-1000)
- `request_timeout_seconds` (optional): HTTP request timeout in seconds, defaults to 30
- `retry_attempts` (optional): Number of retry attempts for failed requests, defaults to 3
- `enable_users_sync` (optional): Whether to sync users/employees data, defaults to true
- `enable_suppliers_sync` (optional): Whether to sync suppliers data, defaults to true
- `enable_payments_sync` (optional): Whether to sync payments data, defaults to true
- `enable_incremental_sync` (optional): Whether to use incremental sync, defaults to true
- `enable_debug_logging` (optional): Enable detailed debug logging, defaults to false

## Requirements file
This connector does not require any additional packages beyond those provided by the Fivetran environment.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
1. Log in to the [AroFlo Developer Portal](https://api.aroflo.com/v1).
2. Register a new application to obtain API credentials.
3. Make a note of the `api_key` from your application settings.
4. Retrieve your company ID from AroFlo administrators if required.
5. Use sandbox credentials for testing, production credentials for live syncing.

Note: The connector uses Bearer token authentication with automatic retry handling. Credentials are never logged or exposed in plain text.

## Pagination
Page-based pagination with automatic page traversal (refer to `get_users_data`, `get_suppliers_data`, and `get_payments_data` functions). Generator-based processing prevents memory accumulation for large datasets. Processes pages sequentially while yielding individual records for immediate processing.

## Data handling
User, supplier, and payment data is mapped from AroFlo's API format to normalized database columns (refer to the `__map_user_data`, `__map_supplier_data`, and `__map_payment_data` functions). Nested objects are flattened, and all timestamps are converted to UTC format for consistency.

Supports timestamp-based incremental synchronization using the `last_sync_time` state parameter (refer to the `get_time_range` function). Initial sync can be configured to fetch historical data up to 365 days using the `initial_sync_days` parameter.

## Error handling
- 429 Rate Limited: Automatic retry with Retry-After header support (refer to the `__handle_rate_limit` function)
- Timeout handling with configurable retry attempts (refer to the `__handle_request_error` function)
- Exponential backoff with jitter prevents multiple clients from making requests at the same time
- Network connectivity issues with automatic retry logic and detailed error logging
- Parameter validation with descriptive error messages provides clear guidance for fixing setup issues

## Tables created
| Table | Primary Key | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| USERS | `id` | Employee personal information, roles, and access levels |
| SUPPLIERS | `id` | Supplier contact information, payment terms, and status |
| PAYMENTS | `id` | Payment transaction records, amounts, and reference data |

Column types are automatically inferred by Fivetran. Sample columns include:

**USERS table**: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `role`, `department`, `employee_id`, `status`, `access_level`, `territory`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

**SUPPLIERS table**: `name`, `contact_person`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `payment_terms`, `tax_id`, `account_code`, `status`

**PAYMENTS table**: `amount`, `currency`, `payment_date`, `payment_method`, `status`, `reference_number`, `customer_id`, `invoice_id`, `job_id`, `transaction_type`, `notes`

## Additional files

The connector includes several additional files to support functionality, testing, and deployment:

- `requirements.txt` – Python dependency specification for AroFlo API integration and connector requirements including faker for mock testing.

- `configuration.json` – Configuration template for API credentials and connector parameters (should be excluded from version control).
