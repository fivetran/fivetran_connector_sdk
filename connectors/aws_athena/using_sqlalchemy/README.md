# AWS Athena Connector Example - Using SQLAlchemy and PyAthena

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to use SQLAlchemy with PyAthena to connect to Amazon Athena, execute a query, and stream the results to Fivetran using the Connector SDK. It shows how to work with paginated result sets using `fetchmany()` and how to construct Athena-compatible connection strings using credentials and S3 staging configuration.

This pattern is helpful when:
- You want to connect to Athena using SQLAlchemy ORM abstraction.
- You prefer PyAthenaâ€™s REST-based driver over raw `boto3` usage.
- You need to work with large Athena query results efficiently.

Note: You must provide your AWS credentials and an S3 staging location for Athena query results.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to Athena using SQLAlchemy + PyAthena REST dialect.
- Streams query results in chunks using `fetchmany()`.
- Emits each row using `op.upsert()` into the `CUSTOMERS` table.
- Performs state checkpointing to support resumable syncs.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "aws_access_key_id": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
  "aws_secret_access_key": "<YOUR_AWS_SECRETS_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "region_name": "<YOUR_REGION_NAME>",
  "database_name": "<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>",
  "s3_staging_dir": "<YOUR_S3_STAGING_DIRECTORY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
PyAthena
sqlalchemy
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Authentication is handled via the credentials passed into the SQLAlchemy connection string:
```
awsathena+rest://<access_key>:<secret_key>@athena.<region>.amazonaws.com:443/<database>?s3_staging_dir=<bucket>
```


## Pagination
- The result set is streamed in chunks using `result.fetchmany(2)`.
- This helps prevent memory overload for large Athena results.


## Data handling
- Query executed: `SELECT * FROM test_rows`.
- Assumes the table contains: `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`.
- Each row is upserted as a dictionary using `op.upsert()`.

## Error handling
- Query results are paginated safely via `fetchmany()`.
- If the connection string is invalid or credentials are wrong, the connector will raise an error.
- Consider wrapping query execution in a `try/except` block for production use.


## Tables created
The connector creates a `CUSTOMERS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "customers",
  "primary_key": ["customer_id"],
  "columns": {
    "customer_id": "STRING",
    "first_name": "STRING",
    "last_name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING"
  }
}
```
