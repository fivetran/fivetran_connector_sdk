# Better Stack Uptime Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs uptime monitoring data from Better Stack's Uptime API. It retrieves monitors, status pages, monitor groups, heartbeats, heartbeat groups, incidents, and on-call calendars, enabling unified monitoring and incident management analytics. The connector implements incremental syncing based on record update timestamps and supports pagination for large datasets.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Incremental syncing based on `updated_at` timestamps for all endpoints
- Automatic pagination handling for large datasets
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Flattening of nested JSON objects for simplified schema
- Support for child tables with foreign key relationships
- State checkpointing after each endpoint sync

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameter:

```json
{
  "api_key": "<YOUR_BETTERSTACK_API_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

This connector uses only the standard library and SDK-provided packages. No additional dependencies are required in `requirements.txt`.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector uses Bearer token authentication to access the Better Stack Uptime API.

To obtain your API key:

1. Log in to your Better Stack account.
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Tokens**.
3. Click **Create API Token**.
4. Copy the generated token and add it to the `api_key` field in your `configuration.json` file.

The API key is passed in the Authorization header as a Bearer token (refer to the `get_headers()` function).

## Pagination

Better Stack API uses page-based pagination with `per_page` and `page` query parameters. The API returns a `pagination` object in each response containing `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last` URLs.

The connector handles pagination automatically (refer to the `fetch_paginated_data()` function):

- Follows the `pagination.next` URL to retrieve subsequent pages
- Stops when `pagination.next` is `null`, indicating the last page
- Uses `per_page=100` to minimize API calls
- Logs progress after each page

## Data handling

The connector processes data as follows (refer to the `sync_endpoint()` and `flatten_record()` functions):

- Fetches records page by page to avoid loading all data into memory
- Flattens nested `attributes` objects into the parent record for simplified schema
- Extracts child relationships (e.g., on-call users) into separate tables with foreign keys
- Filters records based on `updated_at` timestamp for incremental syncing
- Tracks the latest `updated_at` value per endpoint for state management

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling (refer to the `make_api_request()` function):

- Retries transient errors (HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) up to 3 times
- Uses exponential backoff strategy (2, 4, 8 seconds) between retries
- Logs warnings for retry attempts and severe errors for failures
- Raises `RuntimeError` for permanent failures after exhausting retries
- Catches network errors (`Timeout`, `ConnectionError`) with retry logic

## Tables created

The connector creates the following tables (refer to the `schema()` function):

| Table Name | Primary Key | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `monitors` | `id` | Website/API uptime monitors with configuration including URL, monitor type, check frequency, regions, and status |
| `status_pages` | `id` | Public-facing status pages with company info, subdomain, custom domain, theme, and display settings |
| `monitor_groups` | `id` | Logical groupings for monitors with name, sort order, team assignment, and pause status |
| `heartbeats` | `id` | Cron job and scheduled task monitoring with period, grace time, alert settings, and heartbeat group assignment |
| `heartbeat_groups` | `id` | Logical groupings for heartbeats with name, sort order, team assignment, and pause status |
| `incidents` | `id` | Downtime and monitoring failure incidents with cause, timestamps, acknowledgment, resolution details, and alert settings |
| `incident_monitor` | `incident_id`, `id` | Links incidents to their related monitors (child table with foreign key `incident_id`) |
| `on_call_calendars` | `id` | On-call scheduling calendars with name, default status, and team assignment |
| `on_call_users` | `on_call_calendar_id`, `id` | Links users to on-call calendars (child table with foreign key `on_call_calendar_id`) |
