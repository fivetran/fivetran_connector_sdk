# Common Paper Connector

## Connector overview

This connector fetches and syncs agreement data from the Common Paper API. It provides a simple implementation that:
- Fetches agreements using the Common Paper REST API
- Handles incremental syncs using updated_at timestamps
- Converts nested data structures to JSON strings for storage
- Maintains sync state using checkpoints

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Fetches agreement data from Common Paper API
* Supports incremental syncs using updated_at timestamps
* Handles list values by converting them to JSON strings
* Maintains sync state for resumable operations
* Simple authentication using API key

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters in `configuration.json`:

```json
{
    "api_key": "<YOUR_COMMONPAPER_API_KEY>",
    "initial_sync_timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Configuration parameters:
- `api_key`: Your Common Paper API key
- `initial_sync_timestamp`: ISO format timestamp for the initial sync (optional, defaults to current time)

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector does not use any additional Python packages.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector uses API key authentication to access the Common Paper API. The API key should be added to the configuration file for debugging and deploying.

## Data handling

The connector processes data in the following way:
1. Fetches agreements from the Common Paper API using the updated_at filter
2. Processes each agreement record:
   - Extracts attributes from the record
   - Converts any list fields to JSON strings for storage
   - Upserts the data to the destination table
3. Maintains sync state using checkpoints to enable resumable operations

## Error handling

The connector implements basic error handling:
- Validates API responses and raises exceptions for non-200 status codes
- Logs errors using the Fivetran logging system
- Uses checkpoints to ensure sync progress is saved

## Tables Created

The connector creates a single table:

### agreements
Primary key: `id`

This table contains all agreement data from Common Paper, with nested structures stored as JSON strings.
