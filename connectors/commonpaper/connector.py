# This connector demonstrates how to fetch and sync data from the Common Paper API.
# This connector fetches agreement data from the Common Paper API and syncs it to the destination.
# It handles pagination and maintains sync state using checkpoints.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details
