# **fivetran-connector-sdk**
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/fivetran-connector-sdk)](https://pepy.tech/project/fivetran-connector-sdk)

The *fivetran-connector-sdk* allows users to execute custom, self-written Python code within [Fivetran's](https://www.fivetran.com/) secure cloud environment. Fivetran automatically manages running the connectors on your scheduled frequency and manages the required compute resources.

The Connector SDK service is the best fit for the following use cases:
- Fivetran doesn't have a connector for your source and is unlikely to support it soon.
- You are using private APIs, custom applications, unsupported file formats, or those that require pre-processing.
- You have sensitive data that needs filtering or anonymizing before entering the destination.
- You don't want to introduce a 3rd party into your pipeline (e.g., to host a custom function).

To learn more, see our [Connector SDK documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk)

## **Install**

    pip install fivetran-connector-sdk

## **Requirements**
- Python version ≥3.9 and ≤3.12
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## **Getting started**
See [Quickstart guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/quickstart-guide) to get started.

## **Usage**
Import required classes from fivetran_connector_sdk to begin writing your custom data connector

```python
  from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector
  from fivetran_connector_sdk import Logging as log
  from fivetran_connector_sdk import Operations as op
```
See our [Technical Reference](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update) and [Best Practices](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) documentation for more details.
