# DragonflyDB Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs high-performance in-memory data from DragonflyDB to your Fivetran destination. DragonflyDB is a modern, Redis-compatible in-memory datastore designed for cloud environments. The connector enables you to replicate caching layers, session stores, real-time analytics data, rate limiters, and high-throughput key-value stores from DragonflyDB to your data warehouse for historical analysis, compliance, and business intelligence.

The connector is particularly valuable for organizations using DragonflyDB as a high-performance data layer that need to analyze historical patterns, monitor cache effectiveness, track session behavior, or maintain audit trails of their in-memory data operations.

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "host": "<YOUR_DRAGONFLY_HOST>",
  "port": "<YOUR_DRAGONFLY_PORT>",
  "username": "<YOUR_DRAGONFLY_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_DRAGONFLY_PASSWORD>",
  "database": "<YOUR_DRAGONFLY_DATABASE_NUMBER>",
  "ssl": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>",
  "table_name": "<YOUR_DESTINATION_TABLE_NAME>",
  "key_pattern": "<YOUR_KEY_PATTERN>",
  "batch_size": "<YOUR_BATCH_SIZE>"
}
```

Configuration parameters:

- `host` (required) - DragonflyDB server hostname or IP address.
- `port` (required) - DragonflyDB server port (typically 6379).
- `username` (optional) - DragonflyDB authentication username.
- `password` (optional) - DragonflyDB authentication password.
- `database` (optional) - Database number 0-15 (defaults to `0`).
- `ssl` (optional) - Enable SSL/TLS connection - `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`).
- `table_name` (optional) - Destination table name (defaults to `dragonfly_data`).
- `key_pattern` (optional) - Pattern to match keys - supports wildcards (defaults to `*` for all keys).
- `batch_size` (optional) - Number of keys to process per batch (defaults to `100`).

Key pattern examples:
- `*` - All keys
- `cache:*` - All cache keys
- `session:*` - All session keys
- `user:*:profile` - All user profile keys
- `rate_limit:*` - All rate limiter keys

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector uses the `redis` library for connecting to DragonflyDB (Redis-compatible protocol):

```
redis
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector supports flexible authentication options compatible with DragonflyDB deployments (refer to the `build_connection_params` function in [connector.py](connector.py)).

Basic configuration without authentication:
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": "6379",
  "password": ""
}
```

Password-protected DragonflyDB:
```json
{
  "host": "dragonfly.example.com",
  "port": "6379",
  "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
}
```

Username and password authentication:
```json
{
  "host": "dragonfly.example.com",
  "port": "6379",
  "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
}
```

SSL/TLS configuration:
```json
{
  "host": "dragonfly.example.com",
  "port": "6380",
  "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
  "ssl": "true"
}
```

## Pagination

The connector implements the `SCAN` command for efficient, non-blocking key iteration (refer to the `scan_keys` function in [connector.py](connector.py)):

- Uses cursor-based iteration starting from cursor position 0
- Processes keys in configurable batches (default: 100 keys per `SCAN` operation)
- Returns next cursor position for resuming iteration
- Cursor = 0 indicates scan completion
- Implements checkpointing every 1000 keys in the `sync_dragonfly_data` function
- State tracking allows resumption from last cursor position after interruptions

The `SCAN` operation is memory-efficient, non-blocking, and allows other DragonflyDB operations to continue during data extraction.

## Data handling

The connector performs comprehensive data extraction and transformation (refer to the following functions in [connector.py](connector.py)):

- `get_key_info` - Retrieves comprehensive information about a key
- `extract_value_by_type` - Handles type-specific value extraction
- `process_batch` - Processes batches of keys
- `sync_dragonfly_data` - Orchestrates the complete sync process

Data handling workflow:

1. Key discovery - Uses `SCAN` command with optional pattern filtering to discover matching keys
2. Type detection - Identifies data type for each key (string, hash, list, set, zset)
3. Value extraction - Retrieves values using type-specific commands:
  - Strings - Direct value extraction with `GET`
  - Hashes - Extracted with `HGETALL` and converted to JSON objects
  - Lists - Retrieved with `LRANGE` and converted to JSON arrays
  - Sets - Extracted with `SMEMBERS` and converted to JSON arrays
  - Sorted sets - Retrieved with `ZRANGE` including scores, converted to JSON arrays of [member, score] pairs
4. Metadata collection - Gathers TTL (Time-To-Live), size, and timestamp for each key
5. Upsert operations - All records are upserted to handle both new and updated keys

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies (refer to the following functions in [connector.py](connector.py)):

- Connection validation with retry logic (`create_dragonfly_client` function) - Tests DragonflyDB connectivity during client creation with ping operation, implements exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures (max 3 attempts), handles SSL configuration errors, raises RuntimeError on failure.
- Configuration validation (`validate_configuration` function) - Ensures required parameters (host, port) are present, raises ValueError for missing configuration.
- Key access errors (`get_key_info` function) - Handles expired or deleted keys gracefully during scanning, logs warnings for failed key access, returns error record instead of failing.
- Network timeouts (`build_connection_params` function) - Configured 30-second socket timeout for connection resilience.
- Connection cleanup (`update` function finally block) - Ensures connections are properly closed even on errors using try-finally pattern.

## Tables created

The connector creates a table in the destination based on your configuration (configurable via the `table_name` parameter, defaults to `DRAGONFLY_DATA`):

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `key` | STRING | Key name (Primary Key) |
| `value` | STRING | Value - JSON string for complex types (hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets) |
| `data_type` | STRING | Data type: string, hash, list, set, or zset |
| `ttl` | INT | Time to live in seconds (-1 = no expiry, -2 = expired/non-existent) |
| `last_modified` | UTC_DATETIME | Timestamp when key was last processed by connector |
| `size` | INT | Size metric - length for strings, count for collections |

The table uses `key` as the primary key, enabling upserts for handling updated values across syncs.
