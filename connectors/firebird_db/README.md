# Firebird Database Connector

## Connector overview

This connector fetches data from Firebird database tables using the firebirdsql library. The connector retrieves data from multiple tables with multi-threaded processing, pagination support, and incremental sync capabilities.

The connector maintains tables as defined in the `schema.py` file:
- Each table is configured with its own incremental column and primary key
- Tables are processed concurrently using thread pool execution

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating System:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Fetches data from multiple Firebird database tables
* Multi-threaded processing with configurable worker count
* Incremental sync based on configurable incremental columns
* Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
* Automatic datetime conversion to string format
* Thread-safe checkpointing for reliable data synchronization
* Concurrent table processing for improved performance

## Configuration file

The connector requires configuration with your Firebird database credentials:

```json
{
    "host": "<database_host_ip>",
    "database": "<path_to_.fdb_file>",
    "user": "<db_user>",  
    "password": "<db_password>" 
}
```

> NOTE: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Schema file

The connector uses a separate `schema.py` file to define tables and their configuration:

```python
table_list = [
    {
        "table_name": "table_1", 
        "incremental_column": "ID",
        "primary_key": ["ID"]
    },
    {
        "table_name": "table_2", 
        "incremental_column": "DATE_MODIFIED",
        "primary_key": ["ID"]
    },
    {
        "table_name": "table_3", 
        "incremental_column": "DATE_MODIFIED",
        "primary_key": ["ID"]
    }
]
```

## Requirements file

The connector requires the `firebirdsql` package for database connectivity:

```
firebirdsql==1.3.4
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` package is pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector uses standard Firebird database authentication:
- Host IP address or hostname
- Database file path (.fdb file)
- Username and password credentials
- Connection established on port 3050 (default Firebird port)

## Data handling

The connector processes data in the following way:
1. Connects to Firebird database using provided credentials
2. Reads table configuration from `schema.py` file
3. Processes multiple tables concurrently using thread pool
4. Implements incremental sync based on configured incremental columns
5. Converts datetime objects to string format for compatibility
6. Uses batch processing for efficient data retrieval and processing

The connector uses incremental sync based on table-specific incremental columns to avoid duplicate data and ensure efficient synchronization.

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling for:
- Database connection failures
- Thread execution errors with proper logging
- Empty result set handling
- Batch processing boundary conditions
- Thread-safe state management

All errors are logged using the Fivetran logging system for debugging and monitoring.

## Tables Created

The connector creates tables as defined in the `schema.py` file. Each table includes:
- Configurable table name
- Configurable primary key columns
- Configurable incremental sync column
- All columns from the source Firebird table

Example tables:
### table_1
Primary key: `ID`
Incremental column: `ID`

### table_2
Primary key: `ID`
Incremental column: `DATE_MODIFIED`

### table_3
Primary key: `ID`
Incremental column: `DATE_MODIFIED`

## Performance Configuration

The connector includes several configurable performance parameters:
- `batch_process_size`: Number of records processed per upsert (default: 1000)
- `batch_query_size`: Number of records retrieved per query (default: 10000)
- `MAX_WORKERS`: Maximum number of concurrent threads (default: 10)
