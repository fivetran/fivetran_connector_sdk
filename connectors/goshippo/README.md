# Connector SDK Goshippo API Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs shipment data from the Goshippo API to your destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK. Goshippo is a shipping platform that provides APIs to manage shipments, get shipping rates, create labels, and track packages.

The connector fetches shipment records along with related data such as shipping rates, parcel details, and messages. It supports incremental synchronization by tracking the last updated timestamp of shipments and only fetching new or updated records in subsequent syncs.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Incremental sync - Fetches only new or updated shipments since the last sync by tracking the `object_updated` timestamp
- Pagination support - Handles API pagination using next-page URL tokens
- Retry logic - Implements exponential backoff for transient errors (rate limits, timeouts, 5xx errors)
- Related data handling - Syncs shipment rates, parcels, and messages along with shipment records
- Regular checkpointing - Checkpoints state every 100 records to ensure sync can resume from the correct position
- Comprehensive error handling - Catches specific exceptions and provides detailed error logging

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "api_token": "<YOUR_GOSHIPPO_API_TOKEN>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

This connector uses API token authentication to connect to the Goshippo API. The API token is passed in the `Authorization` header as `ShippoToken <api_token>` (refer to the `build_headers()` function).

To obtain your API token:

1. Log in to your [Goshippo account](https://apps.goshippo.com/login).
2. Go to **Settings > API**.
3. Copy your API token or generate a new one.
4. Add the API token to the `configuration.json` file.

## Pagination

The connector implements next-page URL pagination to handle large datasets (refer to the `sync_shipments()` function). The Goshippo API returns a `next` URL in the response when more pages are available. The connector extracts the `page_token` parameter from this URL using the `extract_page_token()` function and includes it in subsequent requests via the `build_query_params()` function.

The pagination loop continues until the API returns no `next` URL, indicating that all available data has been fetched. Each page fetches up to 25 shipments as defined by the `__PAGE_SIZE` constant.

## Data handling

The connector processes shipment data and related entities as follows:

1. Main shipments - The `flatten_shipment()` function extracts and flattens shipment fields including addresses (from, to, return), carrier accounts, and metadata. Nested objects like addresses are flattened into individual columns with prefixes (`from_`, `to_`, `return_`).
2. Related data - The `process_shipment()` function coordinates upserting the main shipment record and its related data:
   - Rates - The `process_rates()` function processes shipping rate options including carrier, amount, service level, and estimated delivery days.
   - Parcels - The `process_parcels()` function processes parcel dimensions, weight, and metadata.
   - Messages - The `process_messages()` function processes API messages with a generated unique ID combining shipment ID and message index.

The connector uses the `op.upsert()` operation to insert or update records in the destination tables. Records are processed immediately as they are fetched to avoid loading large datasets into memory.

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling with retry logic (refer to the `fetch_shipments_page()`, `handle_response_status()`, and `handle_request_exception()` functions):

- Retry logic - The connector retries requests up to 3 times (`__MAX_RETRIES`) for transient errors including:
   - Network timeouts and connection errors
   - Rate limiting (HTTP 429)
   - Server errors (HTTP 500, 502, 503, 504)
- Exponential backoff - The `calculate_retry_delay()` function implements exponential backoff with a maximum delay of 60 seconds.
- Fail fast - The connector immediately raises exceptions for permanent errors like authentication failures (4xx errors) without retrying.
- Specific exception handling - The connector catches specific exceptions (`RuntimeError`, `requests.RequestException`, `ValueError`, `KeyError`, `requests.Timeout`, `requests.ConnectionError`, `AttributeError`, `IndexError`, `TypeError`) rather than generic exceptions to avoid masking unexpected errors.

All errors are logged using the SDK's logging framework before being raised.

## Tables created

The connector creates the `SHIPMENT`, `SHIPMENT_RATES`, `SHIPMENT_PARCELS`, and `SHIPMENT_MESSAGES` tables in the destination. 

Refer to the `schema()` function for more details.
