# Greenplum DB Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector example demonstrates how to fetch data from a Greenplum database and upsert it into destination table using Fivetran Connector SDK. It establishes a connection to a Greenplum database using the `psycopg2` library, executes SQL queries to retrieve data, and streams the results in a memory-efficient manner using server-side cursors.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Connects to Greenplum database using `psycopg2`
- Uses server-side cursors for memory-efficient streaming of large result sets
- Supports incremental syncs with checkpointing
- Automatically converts datetime objects to ISO format
- Validates required configuration parameters

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters to connect to your Greenplum database:

```
{
  "HOST": "<YOUR_GREENPLUM_DATABASE_HOST>",
  "PORT": "<YOUR_GREENPLUM_DATABASE_PORT>",
  "DATABASE": "<YOUR_GREENPLUM_DATABASE_NAME>",
  "USERNAME": "<YOUR_GREENPLUM_DATABASE_USERNAME>",
  "PASSWORD": "<YOUR_GREENPLUM_DATABASE_PASSWORD>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector requires the following Python libraries:

```
psycopg2-binary
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector authenticates with the Greenplum database using username and password credentials provided in the configuration file. Make sure the user has appropriate permissions to read from the tables or views you intend to query.

## Data handling

The connector performs the following data handling operations:  
- Executes SQL queries to fetch data from Greenplum (refer to `GreenplumClient.upsert_data()`)
- Uses server-side cursors to stream large results without loading everything into memory
- Converts datetime objects to ISO format for proper serialization (refer to `GreenplumClient.convert_datetime_to_iso()`)
- Checkpoints progress based on the "`query_start`" field to support incremental syncing

## Error handling

The connector includes error handling for database connection issues. In the `GreenplumClient.connect()` method, connection errors are caught and raised. 

The connector also performs validation of required configuration parameters in the `schema()` function to ensure all necessary credentials are provided before attempting to connect to the database.

## Tables created
The connector creates a single table,  `SAMPLE_TABLE`, in the destination:

```json
{
    "table": "sample_table",
    "primary_key": ["datid"],
    "columns": {
        "datid": "INT",
        "query_start": "UTC_DATETIME"
    }
}
```
