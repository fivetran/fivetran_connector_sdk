# HubSpot Events API Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to sync event analytics data from HubSpot using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It authenticates using an API token, supports incremental syncs via date-based filtering, and creates one destination table per event type. This example specifically syncs `e_visited_page` events.

You can modify it to:
- Sync multiple event types to separate tables.
- Consolidate all event types into a single table.
- Customize fields and event filtering logic.

This connector uses:
- occurredAfter and occurredBefore parameters to define sync windows.
- after (pagination cursor) to iterate through large result sets.

Refer to [HubSpot’s Event Analytics API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/analytics-and-events/event-analytics) for more information.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Authenticates to HubSpot using Bearer Token (`api_token`).
- Syncs only one event type (`e_visited_page`), configurable via `EVENT_TYPE_NAMES`.
- Uses date-based windowing with `occurredAfter` and `occurredBefore`.
- Handles pagination using HubSpot's `after` cursor.
- Transforms nested or list data into JSON strings using `flatten_json` and `list_to_json`.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
    "api_token": "<your_hubspot_api_token>",
    "initial_sync_start_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Authentication is handled via HubSpot Private App token, passed as a Bearer token in the request headers.


## Pagination
Pagination is handled using the `after` cursor returned in HubSpot’s `paging.next.after`.
- The connector loops until no `after` token is returned.
- Pages are requested in batches of 1,000 using `limit`.


## Data handling
- The connector flattens nested `dict` fields and converts any `list` values to JSON strings before sending to Fivetran.
- State is tracked using `start_date` to avoid duplicate syncs.
- The `schema()` method defines a single event table `E_VISITED_PAGE` with `id` as primary key.


## Error handling
- All API responses are checked with `raise_for_status()` to catch errors.
- The connector logs detailed request metadata (URL, params).
- Unrecognized response structures are gracefully handled with fallbacks.


## Tables created
The connector creates a `E_VISITED_PAGE` table:

```json
{
  "table": "e_visited_page",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": "inferred"
}
```
