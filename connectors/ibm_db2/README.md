# IBM DB2 Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector allows you to sync data from IBM Db2 to a destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK. The IBM Db2 connector establishes a connection to your Db2 database, reads data from tables, and incrementally syncs changes using timestamp-based tracking. This example connector demonstrates extracting employee data but can be modified to work with any Db2 table.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Connects to IBM Db2 databases with secure authentication
- Supports incremental data sync using timestamp-based tracking
- Efficient row-level extraction with state management for resumable syncs
- Handles various Db2 data types

## Configuration file

The example connector uses a `configuration.json` file to define the connection parameters for the IBM Db2 database. The connection parameters required for the example to work are:

```json
{
    "hostname" : "<YOUR_DB2_HOSTNAME>",
    "port" : "<YOUR_DB2_PORT>",
    "database" : "<YOUR_DB2_DATABASE_NAME>",
    "user_id" : "<YOUR_DB2_USER_ID>",
    "password" : "<YOUR_DB2_PASSWORD>",
    "schema_name" : "<YOUR_DB2_SCHEMA>",
    "table_name" : "<YOUR_DB2_TABLE_NAME>"
}
```

The configuration parameters are:
- `hostname`: The hostname of your IBM Db2 server 
- `port`: The port number for the Db2 connection
- `database`: The name of your Db2 database
- `user_id`: The username to authenticate with Db2
- `password`: The password to authenticate with Db2
- `schema_name`: The schema name in the Db2 database where the table resides
- `table_name`: The name of the table to sync data from

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector. The content of `requirements.txt` required is:

```
ibm_db==3.2.6
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector uses direct database authentication with a `username` and `password`. These credentials are specified in the configuration file and used to establish a secure connection to the IBM Db2 database. The connection is created using the IBM_DB Python driver, which handles the authentication process.

## Data handling

The connector performs the following data handling operations:  
- Establishes a connection to the IBM Db2 database using the provided credentials
- Tracks the last synced timestamp to enable incremental updates
- Queries tables with a timestamp filter to retrieve only changed records
- Handles various Db2 data types and converts them to appropriate formats

## Error handling

The connector implements the following error handling strategies:  
- Connection failures: Catches database connection errors and provides informative messages
- Configuration validation: Checks for required configuration parameters before attempting connections
- State management: Checkpoints sync progress to enable resumable operations
- Logging: Uses the SDK logging framework to provide detailed information about operations and errors

## Tables created

The example connector creates and syncs the `EMPLOYEE` table, a sample  table containing data about employees with various fields demonstrating different data types.

Schema definition from connector:

```json
{
    "table": "employee",
    "primary_key": ["id"],
    "columns":{
        "id": "INT",
        "first_name": "STRING",
        "last_name": "STRING",
        "email": "STRING",
        "department": "STRING",
        "hire_date": "NAIVE_DATE"
    }
}
```
