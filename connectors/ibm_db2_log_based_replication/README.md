# IBM Db2 Log-Based Replication Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates log-based Change Data Capture (CDC) for IBM Db2 using the Fivetran Connector SDK and IBM's SQL Replication ASN (Apply-Snapshot-Notify) framework.

The ASN Capture daemon (`asncap`) reads the Db2 transaction log and writes every INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to a Change Data (CD) table. This connector reads exclusively from that CD table after the initial full load — it never queries the source table again, making this genuine log-based replication.

```
Db2 transaction log
    └─► asncap daemon  (reads Db2 transaction log)
            └─► {cd_schema_name or schema_name}.CDEMPLOYEE  (Change Data table)
                    └─► this connector  (reads CD table → Fivetran destination)
```


## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features

- Log-based CDC using the ASN SQL Replication framework — no polling of the source table after the initial load
- Full initial load on first sync followed by incremental log-event processing on subsequent syncs
- Ordered change application using a composite `(IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ, IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ)` cursor for exact resume semantics
- Handles inserts, updates, and deletes sourced from the Db2 transaction log
- Regular checkpointing every 500 rows for resumable syncs


## Configuration file

The connector uses `configuration.json` to define the connection parameters for the IBM Db2 database.

```json
{
    "hostname": "<YOUR_Db2_HOSTNAME>",
    "port": "<YOUR_Db2_PORT>",
    "database": "<YOUR_Db2_DATABASE_NAME>",
    "user_id": "<YOUR_Db2_USER_ID>",
    "password": "<YOUR_Db2_PASSWORD>",
    "schema_name": "<YOUR_Db2_SCHEMA_NAME>",
    "cd_schema_name": "<YOUR_Db2_CD_SCHEMA_NAME>"
}
```

The configuration parameters are:
- `hostname` – hostname or IP of the Db2 server
- `port` – TCP port number; default Db2 port is `50000`
- `database` – Db2 database name
- `user_id` – username used to authenticate with Db2
- `password` – password used to authenticate with Db2
- `schema_name` – schema that owns the source `EMPLOYEE` table
- `cd_schema_name` _(optional)_ – schema that owns the ASN Change Data (CD) table (`CDEMPLOYEE`). Defaults to `schema_name` when omitted. 

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python library required by the connector:

```
ibm_db==3.2.6
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication

The connector authenticates with IBM Db2 using `user_id` and `password` supplied via `configuration.json`. These credentials are passed to the `ibm_db.connect()` call inside `connect_to_database()`.


## Data handling

The ASN Capture daemon (`asncap`) reads the Db2 transaction log and writes one row to the Change Data table (`{cd_schema_name or schema_name}.CDEMPLOYEE`) for every committed INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on the source table. Each CD row contains:

- `IBMSNAP_OPERATION` – `'I'` insert, `'U'` update, `'D'` delete
- `IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ` – binary Log Sequence Number (LSN) of the commit, used as the ordering key and cursor
- `IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ` – position within the transaction, used as secondary ordering key
- source columns – row data at the time of the change

CDC state is tracked using the composite cursor `(IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ, IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ)`. Both values are required because multiple rows within the same transaction share the same `IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ`; the `IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ` is needed to resume safely within a commit without skipping or re-applying rows.

The connector processes this data in two phases:

Initial sync:
- `perform_initial_load()` performs a full scan of the `EMPLOYEE` table and upserts every row to the destination.
- The CDC high-water mark `(IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ, IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ)` is captured before the scan starts, so any changes written to the CD table during the scan are not missed on the next sync.

Incremental sync:
- `process_cdc_changes()` reads only the rows in the Change Data table with a CDC position strictly greater than the last processed `(IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ, IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ)` pair, ensuring changes are applied in the exact order they were committed to the database.
- `'I'` and `'U'` rows are applied as `op.upsert()`; `'D'` rows are applied as `op.delete()`.
- The new high-water `(IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ, IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ)` values are saved to state after processing.

### Checkpointing
- Both `last_commit_sequence` (the `IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ` hex value) and `last_intent_sequence` (the `IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ` hex value) are stored in state. Both values are required because multiple CD rows can share the same `IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ` — one per statement within a transaction — and using only `IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ` would cause rows to be re-processed or skipped when resuming from a mid-commit checkpoint.
- State is checkpointed every 500 CD rows and once more at the end of each sync, so a mid-sync failure resumes from the last checkpoint rather than from the beginning.


## Error handling

Refer to `validate_configuration()` and `connect_to_database()` for implementation details.

- Missing or empty configuration keys – `validate_configuration()` raises a `ValueError` before any connection is attempted, identifying the missing key.
- Invalid port – `validate_configuration()` checks that `port` is an integer in the range 1–65535 and raises a `ValueError` with the actual value if not.
- Connection failures – these are caught in `connect_to_database()`, logged with `log.severe()`, and re-raised as a `RuntimeError`.
- Unknown ASN operations – these are logged as a warning by `process_cdc_changes()` and skipped; the sync continues.
- Resumable syncs – the composite `(IBMSNAP_COMMITSEQ, IBMSNAP_INTENTSEQ)` cursor is checkpointed regularly so a mid-sync failure resumes from the last checkpoint.


## Tables created

The connector creates and syncs the `employee` table in the destination:

| Column | Type | Primary key |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INT | Yes |
| `first_name` | STRING | No |
| `last_name` | STRING | No |
| `email` | STRING | No |
| `department` | STRING | No |
| `salary` | FLOAT | No |
