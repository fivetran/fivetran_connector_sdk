# IMPORTANT: The recommended way to test your connector is using the Fivetran debug command:
#   fivetran debug
#
# This local testing block is provided as a convenience for quick debugging during development,
# such as using IDE debug tools (breakpoints, step-through debugging, etc.).
# Note: This method is not called by Fivetran when executing your connector in production.
# Always test using 'fivetran debug' prior to finalizing and deploying your connector.
