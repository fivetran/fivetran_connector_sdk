# Iterate NPS Survey Connector Example

## Connector overview
This custom Fivetran connector extracts NPS survey data from the [Iterate](https://iteratehq.com/) REST API and loads it into your destination. The connector fetches NPS surveys and their individual responses, providing complete survey analytics data for downstream analysis.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Extracts survey metadata from the `/surveys` endpoint
- Extracts individual survey responses from the `/surveys/{id}/responses` endpoint
- Uses the`start_date` parameter with strict UTC format validation for incremental syncs
- Processes all paginated data automatically using links object within a single sync
- Implements exponential backoff for API reliability (3 retries with progressive delays)
- Flattens nested JSON structures into table columns automatically
- Simple checkpointing only upon the successful completion of a sync
- UTC date/time enforcement eliminates timezone ambiguity

## Configuration file
The configuration requires your Iterate API access token and optionally a start date for the initial sync.

```
{
  "api_token": "<YOUR_ITERATE_API_TOKEN>",
  "start_date": "<YOUR_OPTIONAL_START_DATE>"
}
```

Configuration parameters:
- `api_token` (required): Your Iterate API access token.
- `start_date` (optional): UTC datetime in ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix (e.g., "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"). If not provided, sync starts from EPOCH time (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) to capture all historical data.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
The `requirements.txt` file specifies additional Python libraries required by the connector. Following Fivetran best practices, this connector doesn't require additional dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
The connector uses API key authentication via the `x-api-key` header. To obtain your API access token:

1. Log into your Iterate account.
2. Go to **Account settings**.
3. Find and make a note of your API access token.
4. Add the token to your `configuration.json` file as shown above.

## Pagination
The connector handles pagination automatically using Iterate API's `links` object structure. When the API returns a `links.next` URL, the connector continues fetching additional pages until all data is retrieved within a single sync operation.

- Each sync processes all paginated data completely using `fetch_survey_responses()`.
- Pagination state is not persisted between sync runs for cleaner state management.
- Uses the `start_date` Unix timestamp parameter to filter responses from API directly.
- Each sync fetches all relevant data from start_date to current time.

The `fetch_survey_responses()` function handles both initial requests and paginated follow-ups using the appropriate API call method.

## Data handling
The connector processes survey and response data with an optimized incremental sync strategy:

- **Survey data**: Fetches all surveys using `/surveys` endpoint and flattens nested JSON structures into columns.
- **Response data**: For each survey, fetches individual responses using `/surveys/{id}/responses` endpoint with date-based filtering and automatic pagination.

### Enhanced sync strategy
- Initial sync uses `start_date` from configuration (if provided) or EPOCH time (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) as a fallback solution
- Incremental syncs use `last_survey_sync` timestamp from state to fetch only new responses since the last successful sync
- UTC consistency for all datetime operations with the 'Z' suffix format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
- Single checkpoint saves the state only after a complete successful sync to prevent data gaps from partial failures

### Data transformation
- JSON flattening converts nested dictionaries to underscore-separated columns (e.g., `author.id` -> `author_id`)
- List handling converts arrays to JSON strings for storage
- Foreign keys maintain relationships with `survey_id` field included in each response
- Type safety through configuration validation ensuring required fields exist before processing

### Key functions
- `parse_iso_datetime_to_unix()`: Handles strict UTC datetime parsing with validation
- `make_iterate_api_call()`: Centralized API calling with common headers and error handling
- `flatten_dict()`: Recursive JSON structure flattening for table columns
- `validate_configuration()`: Comprehensive config validation with datetime format checking

The connector maintains a clean state with only the `last_survey_sync` timestamp, automatically advancing after each successful sync to ensure reliable incremental syncs without data duplication or gaps.

## Error handling
The connector implements comprehensive error handling with multiple layers of protection:

### Configuration validation (`validate_configuration()`)
- Validates required `api_token` field exists and is not empty
- Provides clear error messages for configuration issues with format examples

### API request resilience (`make_api_request()`)
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts with progressive delays)
- Handles HTTP errors, timeouts, and network issues gracefully
- Detailed logging for debugging API connectivity problems

### Centralized API logic (`make_iterate_api_call()`)
- Consistent header management and authentication for all API calls
- Automatic API version parameter inclusion
- Unified error handling across all endpoints

### Data processing safeguards
- Graceful handling of missing or malformed API response structures
- Safe dictionary access patterns to prevent KeyError exceptions
- Proper exception propagation with descriptive RuntimeError messages

All exceptions are caught at the top level and re-raised as `RuntimeError` with descriptive messages, making troubleshooting easier for users and Fivetran support.

## Tables created

The connector creates the following tables in your destination:

| Table name | Primary key | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `SURVEY`   | `id`        | Survey metadata and configuration with flattened JSON properties |
| `RESPONSE` | `id`        | Individual survey responses with relationship to parent survey (includes `survey_id` foreign key) |

All tables include flattened versions of complex nested objects, with nested properties converted to underscore-separated columns (e.g., `author.id` becomes `author_id`).
