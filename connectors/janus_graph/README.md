# JanusGraph Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector integrates JanusGraph graph database with Fivetran's data pipeline using the Gremlin Server API. JanusGraph is a scalable graph database optimized for storing and querying large graphs with billions of vertices and edges distributed across a multi-machine cluster.

The connector extracts vertices, edges, and their properties from JanusGraph and delivers them to your data warehouse in a flattened, analytics-ready format. It supports both full and incremental synchronization based on `updated_at` timestamps when available. This enables graph relationship analytics, operational observability, and compliance tracking for enterprises leveraging JanusGraph for knowledge graphs, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and network analysis.

Key capabilities include:
- Schema discovery via JanusGraph management API queries
- Incremental sync with automatic checkpoint management
- Pagination support for large graph datasets using Gremlin `range()` step
- Flattened property tables for multi-valued properties
- Relationship tracking between vertices via edges with source and target IDs

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
    - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
    - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
    - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Incremental synchronization: Automatically detects and uses `updated_at` property on vertices and edges for efficient incremental syncs. Falls back to full sync if the property is not present.
- Pagination support: Handles large graph datasets efficiently using Gremlin `range()` step with configurable batch size (default 1000 records per batch).
- Schema discovery: Automatically discovers vertex labels, edge labels, and property keys from JanusGraph management API.
- Multi-valued property handling: Creates separate property tables for vertices and edges with multi-valued properties, maintaining property order with indexes.
- Relationship preservation: Captures graph structure by storing `in_vertex_id` and `out_vertex_id` in the edges table for relationship analytics.
- Retry logic: Implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism for transient Gremlin server failures.
- Checkpoint management - Automatically checkpoints the state after each batch to enable resume capability on interruptions.

## Configuration file

For development (without authentication):
```json
{
  "gremlin_server_url": "ws://localhost:8182/gremlin",
  "traversal_source": "g"
}
```

For production (with authentication):
```json
{
  "gremlin_server_url": "<YOUR_GREMLIN_SERVER_URL>",
  "traversal_source": "<YOUR_TRAVERSAL_SOURCE_NAME>",
  "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
}
```

### Configuration parameters
- `gremlin_server_url` (required): The WebSocket URL of your Gremlin Server (e.g., `ws://localhost:8182/gremlin` for development or `wss://your-server:8182/gremlin` for production with SSL)
- `traversal_source` (required): The graph traversal source name, typically `g` (default traversal source in JanusGraph)
- `username` (optional): Username for authenticated connections to the Gremlin Server
- `password` (optional): Password for authenticated connections to the Gremlin Server

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector requires the `gremlinpython` package to communicate with the Gremlin Server API:

```
gremlinpython
```

The `gremlinpython` library provides:
- WebSocket-based client for Gremlin Server connections
- GraphSON serialization for query requests and responses
- Support for graph traversal queries and management operations

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector supports both authenticated and unauthenticated connections to the Gremlin Server API using WebSocket connections.

- Development mode (no authentication):
- JanusGraph's Gremlin Server runs without authentication by default
- Use `ws://` protocol in `gremlin_server_url`
- Omit `username` and `password` from configuration

- Production mode (with authentication):
1. Configure authentication on your JanusGraph Gremlin Server by editing `gremlin-server.yaml`:
    - Add authentication handler (e.g., Simple Authentication)
    - Configure username and password credentials

2. Add authentication credentials to your `configuration.json`:
    - Use `wss://` protocol for secure connections
    - Include `username` and `password` parameters

The connector automatically detects authentication credentials in the configuration and establishes authenticated connections when provided (refer to `create_gremlin_client()` function in connector.py).

## Pagination

The connector implements pagination using Gremlin's `range()` step to handle large graph datasets without loading all data into memory at once (refer to `sync_vertices()` and `sync_edges()` functions in connector.py).

Pagination implementation:
- Batch size is controlled by the `__BATCH_SIZE` constant (default: 1000 records)
- Uses `range(offset, offset + batch_size)` in Gremlin queries
- Automatically detects end of data when fewer records than batch size are returned
- Checkpoints state after each batch for resume capability
- Offset increments by batch size for next iteration

For incremental syncs, pagination combines with timestamp filtering:
```gremlin
g.V().has('updated_at', gt('2024-01-15T10:00:00Z'))
  .order().by('updated_at')
  .range(0, 1000)
```

For full syncs without `updated_at` property:
```gremlin
g.V().range(0, 1000)
```

## Data handling

The connector transforms JanusGraph graph data into four relational tables optimized for warehouse analytics:

**Data transformation approach:**
- Flattens single-valued properties directly into vertex and edge tables as columns
- Creates separate property tables for multi-valued properties to avoid data loss
- Converts all vertex and edge IDs to strings for consistent identifier handling
- Preserves property ordering using `property_index` for list-type properties
- Automatically infers column data types from property values

### Incremental sync logic (refer to `check_updated_at_property()` function in connector.py)
- On first sync, checks if vertices/edges have `updated_at` property
- If present, uses timestamp-based filtering for subsequent syncs: `g.V().has('updated_at', gt(last_checkpoint))`
- State tracks separate timestamps: `vertices_last_updated_at` and `edges_last_updated_at`
- Falls back to full sync if `updated_at` property is not available

### Schema discovery (refer to schema discovery functions in connector.py)
- Queries JanusGraph management API for vertex labels, edge labels, and property keys
- Uses fallback queries to discover labels from actual data if the management API fails
- Minimal schema definition with primary keys and core columns
- Additional properties are auto-discovered by Fivetran from the data

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling with retry logic for transient failures:

Retry mechanism (refer to `execute_gremlin_query_with_retry()` function in connector.py):
- Retries Gremlin queries up to 5 times (controlled by `__MAX_RETRIES` constant)
- Uses exponential backoff: sleep time = min(60, 2^attempt) seconds
- Catches specific exceptions: `GremlinServerError`, `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`
- Logs each retry attempt with a warning level for monitoring
- Raises `RuntimeError` after exhausting all retry attempts

Error scenarios handled:
- Connection failures to Gremlin Server (network issues, server restarts)
- Query timeout errors for long-running graph traversals
- Server-side errors during query execution
- Schema discovery failures with automatic fallback to data-driven discovery

Fail-fast behavior:
- Configuration validation fails immediately on missing required parameters
- Final exception raised after all retries are exhausted to alert Fivetran
- Client connection cleanup in `finally` block to prevent resource leaks

## Tables created

The connector creates four tables in your destination warehouse:
