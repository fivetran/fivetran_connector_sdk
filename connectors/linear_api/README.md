# Linear API Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to use the **Linear GraphQL API** with the **Fivetran Connector SDK** to extract and sync entities such as **issues**, **projects**, **teams**, **users**, and **comments** into your destination.

It highlights one of the core advanced features — **Isolated Endpoint Sync**, which allows each Linear entity to sync independently. This ensures that if one entity fails (for example, `issues`), other entities (`projects`, `teams`, `users`, etc.) continue syncing successfully, improving connector reliability.

This connector supports:
- Incremental syncs based on `updatedAt`.
- Soft delete detection using `archivedAt`.
- GraphQL cursor-based pagination.
- Isolated endpoint failure handling and recovery.
- Full checkpointing for resuming syncs.

The connector communicates with the [Linear API](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api) and requires a valid **Linear API key**.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
    - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
    - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
    - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) for installation instructions, configuration setup, and local testing.

---

## Features
- Connects to the **Linear GraphQL API** securely using API keys.
- Fetches data from multiple entities (`issues`, `projects`, `teams`, `users`, `comments`).
- Performs **incremental replication** using `updatedAt`.
- Captures soft deletes using the `archivedAt` field.
- Implements **cursor-based pagination** (`hasNextPage`, `endCursor`).
- Executes **Isolated Endpoint Sync** — a major feature that runs each entity independently, capturing and logging individual failures without stopping other syncs.
- Tracks and persists checkpoints (`op.checkpoint()`) for resumable syncs.
- Converts datetimes into UTC ISO 8601 format for consistent data.

## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "linear_api_key": "<YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY>"
}
```

### Configuration parameters

| Key | Required | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `linear_api_key` | Yes | Your Linear API key used for GraphQL authentication. |

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

---

## Authentication
This connector uses **Bearer Token Authentication** for all Linear GraphQL requests.

Example request header:

```
Authorization: <YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### How to obtain your API key
1. Log in to your [Linear account](https://linear.app/).
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys**.
3. Generate a personal API key and copy it.
4. Add it to your `configuration.json` file under `linear_api_key`.

---

## Pagination
Pagination is handled using the **GraphQL `pageInfo` object**.  
The connector continues fetching data until all pages are retrieved.

- `hasNextPage`: indicates if additional pages exist.
- `endCursor`: provides the cursor token for the next page.

Example:
```graphql
query IssuesList($cursor: String, $count: Int) {
  issues(first: $count, after: $cursor, orderBy: updatedAt) {
    nodes {
      id
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      archivedAt
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Data handling
The connector processes and syncs Linear data using the following workflow:

1. **Incremental syncs**
    - Each entity (e.g., `issues`, `projects`) is queried using the `updatedAt` filter:
      ```graphql
      filter: { updatedAt: { gt: "<last_updated>" } }
      ```
    - Fetches only new or updated records since the last checkpoint.

2. **Upserts**
    - New or modified records are written via:
      ```python
      op.upsert(entity, record)
      ```

3. **Deletes**
    - Records with non-null `archivedAt` are soft-deleted via:
      ```python
      op.delete(entity, {"id": record["id"]})
      ```

4. **Checkpointing**
    - The connector tracks `last_updated` for each entity independently:
      ```python
      yield op.checkpoint({"issues": {"last_updated": "2025-10-26T00:00:00Z"}})
      ```

---

## Isolated Endpoint Sync
A major feature of this connector is **Isolated Endpoint Sync**.  
Each entity (issues, projects, teams, users, comments) runs independently in isolation.

### How it works:
- If one entity fails during the sync, it logs the failure without stopping the rest.
- The connector continues syncing other entities normally.
- After all syncs finish, it raises a summarized exception listing failed endpoints.

This approach ensures **fault tolerance** and **resilience** — particularly useful when dealing with large-scale or partially degraded API responses.

Example log:
```
Starting isolated sync for issues (last_updated=2025-10-25T10:00:00Z)
issues sync failed: 500 Internal Server Error
Continuing with projects, teams, and users...
IsolatedEndpointSync detected failed endpoints -> issues: 500 Internal Server Error
```

---

## Error handling
The connector implements robust error handling for API and sync operations:
- **HTTP Errors (4xx/5xx)** – Logged and retried with exponential backoff.
- **GraphQL Errors** – Logged with full error details and halted for that entity only.
- **Network Failures** – Automatically retried with incremental delays.
- **Partial Failures** – Isolated by entity; other syncs continue running.
- **Rate Limits** – The Linear API’s standard 400 requests/minute limit is respected.

---

## Tables created
The connector creates a table for each synced entity.

| Table name | Primary key | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `issues` | `id` | Tracks issues with created, updated, and archived timestamps. |
| `projects` | `id` | Stores project metadata and lifecycle data. |
| `teams` | `id` | Contains team metadata and relationships. |
| `users` | `id` | Captures user accounts and updates. |
| `comments` | `id` | Stores comment text and timestamps. |

Each table includes:
- `id`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `archivedAt`

---

## Additional considerations
- Incremental syncs depend on the `updatedAt` field — ensure it exists for all entities.
- Soft deletes use the `archivedAt` timestamp; archived records are removed from destinations.
- The connector is designed for **educational and demonstration purposes** using the **Fivetran Connector SDK**.
