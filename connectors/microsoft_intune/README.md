# Microsoft Intune Connector SDK Example

This example demonstrates how to build a connector for [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-intune) with Fivetran Connector SDK, using the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api) to retrieve managed device data. The connector pulls data from the Intune managed devices endpoint and delivers it to your Fivetran destination in a single table called `MANAGED_DEVICES`.

## Requirements

* Microsoft Intune credentials: `tenant_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`
* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating System:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Retrieves managed device data from Microsoft Intune using the Microsoft Graph API (see `update` function)
* Handles API pagination using the `@odata.nextLink` field (see `update` function)
* Converts list values in device records to JSON strings for compatibility (see `list_to_json` function)
* Delivers data to a single table, `MANAGED_DEVICES`
* Uses Fivetran Connector SDK logging for status and error reporting (see `log` usage)

## Configuration file

The connector expects a `configuration.json` file with the following structure:

```
{
  "tenant_id": "YOUR_TENANT_ID",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

The connector uses a OAuth2 client credentials flow to authenticate with Microsoft Graph API. You will need to provide your Azure tenant ID, client ID, and client secret in the `configuration.json` file. The connector retrieves an access token using these credentials (see `get_access_token` function in `test.py`).

## Pagination

The connector handles pagination using the `@odata.nextLink` field returned by the Microsoft Graph API. It continues to request additional pages until all managed devices are retrieved (see `update` function, lines ~38-81).

## Data handling

* Data is retrieved from the Microsoft Graph API using the `update` function (see lines ~38-81)
* List values in device records are converted to JSON strings using the `list_to_json` function (see lines ~84-89)
* Data is delivered to Fivetran using the `op.upsert` operation
* The schema is defined in the `schema` function (see lines ~13-18)

## Error handling

* Uses Fivetran Connector SDK logging for info and severe error messages (see `log` usage throughout)
* Raises exceptions for failed authentication or API errors (see `get_access_token` and `update` functions)

## Tables created

* `managed_devices` â€“ Contains all managed device records retrieved from Microsoft Intune.

*Sample data structure:*

| id                                   | deviceName | operatingSystem | ... |
|--------------------------------------|------------|----------------|-----|
| 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef | SurfacePro | Windows        | ... |
