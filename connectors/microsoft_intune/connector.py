# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# The code will retrieve managed Devices from Microsoft InTune and create one table called managed_devices
# You will need to provide your own Microsoft credentials for this to work --> "tenant_id", "client_id", and "client_secret" in configuration.json
# Relevant Microsoft API documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/intune-devices-manageddevice-list?view=graph-rest-1.0
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
