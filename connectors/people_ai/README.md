# People.ai Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to extract activity and participant data from the People.ai API and load it into a destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK.  
The connector:
- Authenticates with OAuth2 using the client credentials grant type.
- Retrieves records from `/v0/public/activities` and `/v0/public/activities/{type}` endpoints.
- Supports token refresh and exponential backoff on transient errors.
- Upserts all records into their respective destination tables (`activity`, `participants`).

Related functions in `connector.py`:  
`schema`, `update`, `get_page`, `sync_base_activities`, `sync_activity_type`, `get_access_token`, `validate_configuration`.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) for setup instructions.

For local testing, this example includes a `__main__` block that reads `configuration.json` and runs `connector.debug(...)`.

## Features
- Activity ingestion: Retrieves paginated activity data from `/v0/public/activities`.
- Participants sync: Retrieves participant details from `/v0/public/activities/participants`.
- Authentication: Automatically refreshes the access token when a 401 response is received.
- Error handling: Retries failed requests with exponential backoff for transient 5xx and connection errors.
- Schema: Defines two destination tables — `activity` and `participants`.

## Configuration file
The `configuration.json` file provides API credentials required for authentication.

```json
{
  "api_key": "<YOUR_PEOPLE_AI_API_KEY>",
  "api_secret": "<YOUR_PEOPLE_AI_API_SECRET>"
}
```
- `api_key`: Your People.ai API key (client ID).  
- `api_secret`: Your People.ai API secret (client secret).

### Notes
- Ensure that `configuration.json` is not committed to version control.  
- Both configuration values are required; the connector will raise an error if either is missing.

## Authentication
- Type: OAuth2 Client Credentials  
- Token URL: `https://api.people.ai/auth/v1/tokens`  
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`  
- Grant Type: `client_credentials`  
- Access Token Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

Authentication is handled by `get_access_token`.  
The connector uses a reauthentication closure (`reauthenticate`) to refresh the token automatically when a `401` error occurs.

## Pagination
Both `/activities` and `/activities/{type}` endpoints use offset-based pagination.

- The connector fetches data in pages using `limit` and `offset` query parameters.  
- Pagination continues until fewer than `limit` records are returned.  
- Each page is upserted into the destination table using `op.upsert(...)`.

Functions responsible for pagination:
- `get_page`: Fetches a single page with retry and reauth logic.  
- `sync_base_activities`: Iterates through all pages for `/activities`.  
- `sync_activity_type`: Iterates through all pages for `/activities/{type}` (e.g., `participants`).

## Data handling
- Schema definition: `schema(configuration)` defines two tables:
  - `activity` (primary key: `uid`)
  - `participants` (primary key: `uid`, `email`)
- Renaming: The `subject` field (if present) is renamed to `api_subject` to avoid conflicts.  
- Upserts: All rows are written using `op.upsert(...)` to allow incremental updates.  
- Error resilience:
  - Retries up to five times for `5xx` and network errors with exponential backoff.  
  - Refreshes the access token once upon a `401` error.

## Error handling
- 401 Unauthorized: Triggers a single reauthentication attempt using `reauth_func`.  
- 502–599 Server Errors: Retries the request up to 5 times, with delays increasing exponentially (`2, 4, 8, 16, 32` seconds).  
- Connection errors: Retries similarly to `5xx` cases.  
- Configuration validation: Early failure if `api_key` or `api_secret` are missing.  
- Logging: Uses `fivetran_connector_sdk.Logging` for all status, error, and retry messages.

## Tables created
Summary of tables replicated.

### activity
- Primary key: `uid`  
- Selected columns (not exhaustive):  
  `uid`, `sub_type`, `created_at`, `activity_type`, `updated_at`

### participants
- Primary key: `uid`, `email`  
- Selected columns (not exhaustive):  
  `uid`, `email`, `status`, `name`, `ingested_at`, `phone_number`

## Additional files
- `connector.py` – Contains all core logic: `schema`, `update`, `get_page`, `sync_base_activities`, `sync_activity_type`, `get_access_token`, and `validate_configuration`.  
- `configuration.json` – Contains API credentials (`api_key`, `api_secret`).  
- `requirements.txt` – Lists any third-party Python libraries required (e.g., `requests`).
