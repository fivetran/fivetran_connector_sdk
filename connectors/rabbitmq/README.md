# RabbitMQ Connector SDK Example

## Connector overview
This connector syncs messages from RabbitMQ queues to Fivetran. The connector retrieves messages from specified queues using RabbitMQ's `basic_get` method. It consumes the messages only after a successful sync to prevent duplicate reads.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Synchronizes messages from multiple RabbitMQ queues
- Captures complete message metadata including delivery tags, routing keys, headers, and timestamps
- Implements incremental sync with per-queue state tracking using delivery tags
- Configurable batch size for optimal performance
- Checkpointing every 500 messages for reliable sync resumption
- Supports CloudAMQP and self-hosted RabbitMQ deployments
- AMQPS/TLS support for secure communication

## Configuration file


```json
{
  "connection_url": "<YOUR_RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_URL>",
  "queues": "<YOUR_COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST_OF_RABBITMQ_QUEUES>",
  "batch_size": "<YOUR_BATCH_SIZE>"
}
```

The configuration keys required for your connector are as follows:

- `connection_url` (required) - Full AMQP/AMQPS connection URL including credentials, host, and virtual host (see Authentication section for format examples)
- `queues` (required) - Comma-separated list of queue names to sync (for example: "orders,payments,notifications")
- `batch_size` (optional) - Number of messages to process per batch (defaults to 100)

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector:

```
pika==1.3.2
```

The connector uses the `pika` library (version 1.3.2) for connecting to and consuming messages from RabbitMQ.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
The connector uses AMQP connection URLs for authentication. The connection URL includes credentials embedded in the URL format.

Example configurations:

- CloudAMQP (recommended for testing):
```json
{
  "connection_url": "amqps://username:password@host.cloudamqp.com/vhost"
}
```

- Local RabbitMQ (default credentials):
```json
{
  "connection_url": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
}
```

- Self-hosted with custom credentials:
```json
{
  "connection_url": "amqps://myuser:mypassword@rabbitmq.example.com:5671/production"
}
```

The connector automatically handles AMQPS/TLS connections when using the `amqps://` protocol scheme.

## Data handling

**Important**: Messages are permanently removed from RabbitMQ after a successful sync. This connector consumes messages using `basic_ack`, which deletes them from the queue. Use this connector only with dedicated analytical queues (for example, dead-letter or audit queues); never use it on production operational queues.

The connector performs message consumption and transformation. Refer to the `fetch_and_upsert_messages_batch` function for message handling:

- Queue discovery - Declares queues passively to verify existence and get message counts
- Message retrieval - Uses `basic_get` with `auto_ack=False` to fetch messages with manual acknowledgment
- Incremental filtering - Skips messages with delivery tags less than or equal to the last synced tag
- Message parsing - Handles different content types (application/json, text) with proper decoding
- Metadata extraction - Captures all RabbitMQ message properties (headers, routing keys, timestamps, delivery mode)
- Message consumption - Acknowledges messages with `basic_ack` after a successful sync to prevent re-reading
- Upsert operations - All records are upserted based on a unique message_id (generated from queue, delivery_tag, and body hash)

The `update` function orchestrates the complete sync process with state management and error handling for multiple queues.

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies. Refer to the following functions:

- Configuration validation (`validate_configuration`) - Ensures required parameters (connection_url, queues) are present
- Connection error handling (`create_rabbitmq_connection`) - Handles AMQP connection errors with detailed logging and runtime errors
- Channel error handling (`fetch_and_upsert_messages_batch`) - Handles AMQP channel errors during message retrieval
- Message parsing errors (`fetch_and_upsert_messages_batch`) - Gracefully handles message decoding failures with fallback to string representation
- Connection cleanup (`update` function finally block) - Ensures RabbitMQ connections are properly closed even on errors

## Tables created

The connector creates a separate table for each queue specified in the configuration file. Column types are automatically inferred by Fivetran based on the data. Each table includes the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| message_id | STRING | Unique message identifier (Primary Key) - hash of queue, delivery_tag, and body |
| delivery_tag | INT | RabbitMQ delivery tag for message ordering |
| queue_name | STRING | Source queue name |
| routing_key | STRING | Routing key used to deliver the message |
| exchange | STRING | Source exchange name |
| message_body | STRING | Message content (JSON or text) |
| content_type | STRING | Content type (e.g., application/json) |
| content_encoding | STRING | Content encoding (e.g., utf-8) |
| delivery_mode | INT | Message persistence mode (1=non-persistent, 2=persistent) |
| priority | INT | Message priority (0-255) |
| correlation_id | STRING | Correlation ID for request-response patterns |
| reply_to | STRING | Reply-to queue for response messages |
| expiration | STRING | Message expiration time |
| message_id_header | STRING | Message ID from message headers |
| timestamp | UTC_DATETIME | Message timestamp from RabbitMQ |
| type | STRING | Message type identifier |
| user_id | STRING | User ID that published the message |
| app_id | STRING | Application ID that published the message |
| headers | STRING | Additional message headers as JSON string |
| redelivered | BOOLEAN | Whether message was redelivered |
| synced_at | UTC_DATETIME | Timestamp when message was synced by the connector |

Table names are derived from queue names (lowercase with special characters replaced by underscores).
