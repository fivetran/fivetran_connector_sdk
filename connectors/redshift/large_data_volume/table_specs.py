# List of table specifications for the Redshift connector
# Each dictionary in the list defines a table and its sync configuration
# You can modify this list to add or change table configurations as needed
# Each table spec includes:
# - name: The name of the table in the format "schema.table"
# - primary_keys: List of primary key columns for the table
# - strategy: Replication strategy, either "FULL" or "INCREMENTAL"
# - replication_key: Column used for incremental replication (if applicable).
# - include: List of columns to include in the sync (empty list means all columns)
# - exclude: List of columns to exclude from the sync (empty list means no exclusions)
