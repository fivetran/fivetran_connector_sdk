# Redshift Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates how to sync records from a Redshift database using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It establishes a connection to a Redshift instance and incrementally extracts customer data based on an update timestamp, transforming the records into a standardized format for loading into the destination.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Direct connection to Redshift database
- Incremental data extraction based on timestamp
- Support for primary key identification

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```
{
  "host": "<YOUR_REDSHIFT_HOST>",
  "database": "<YOUR_REDSHIFT_DATABASE>",
  "port": "<YOUR_REDSHIFT_PORT>",
  "user": "<YOUR_REDSHIFT_USER>",
  "password": "<YOUR_REDSHIFT_PASSWORD>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector requires the `redshift_connector` package to connect to Redshift databases.

```
redshift_connector
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector uses username and password authentication to connect to Redshift. The credentials are specified in the configuration file and passed to the `redshift_connector.connect()` function (refer to the `connect_to_redshift()` function).

To set up authentication:

1. Create a Redshift user with appropriate permissions to access the required tables.
2. Provide the username and password in the `configuration.json` file.
3. Ensure the user has `SELECT` permissions on the tables that need to be synced.

## Pagination

The connector implements a simple pagination strategy by fetching records in batches of 2 rows at a time (refer to the `cursor.fetchmany(2)` call in the `update()` function). After processing each batch, the connector:

- Performs upsert operations for each record
- Updates the state with the latest timestamp
- Performs a checkpoint operation to save progress

This approach ensures reliable processing of large datasets and allows the connector to resume from where it left off if interrupted.

## Data handling

The connector handles data as follows (refer to the `update()` function):

- Connects to the Redshift database using the provided configuration
- Retrieves the last sync timestamp from state (or uses a default date for initial sync)
- Executes a SQL query to fetch records modified after the last sync timestamp
- Transforms each database record into the target schema format
- Performs upsert operations for each record
- Maintains state with the latest processed timestamp

The `dt2str()` function handles timestamp formatting, converting database datetime objects to the required string format.

## Tables Created

The connector creates a single table named `customers` with the following schema (refer to the `schema()` function):

```json
 {
  "table": "customers",
  "primary_key": ["customer_id"],
  "columns": {
    "customer_id": "INT",
    "first_name": "STRING",
    "last_name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "updated_at": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
