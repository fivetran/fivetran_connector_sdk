# Scrunch Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example shows how to pull AI/ML response and aggregate data from the Scrunch API and load it into a destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK. Scrunch provides individual responses, citations, and performance metrics across prompts, personas, and platforms. The connector:
- Retrieves paginated responses (raw records).
- Executes aggregate queries for overall performance, competitor performance, and daily citations.
- Flattens lists and serializes nested objects for destination compatibility.
- Implements checkpointed incremental syncs per dataset.

Related functions in `connector.py`: `schema`, `update`, `get_all_responses`, `get_responses`, `flatten_response`, `get_scrunch_performance`, `get_competitor_performance`, `get_daily_citations`.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements) 
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only).
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64]).
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64).

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

For local testing, this example includes a `__main__` block that reads `configuration.json` and runs `connector.debug(...)`.

## Features
- Responses ingestion: offset-based pagination over `/v1/{account_id}/responses`.
  - Refer to `get_all_responses` and `get_responses`.
- Aggregates:
  - Overall Scrunch performance.
    - Refer to `get_scrunch_performance`.
  - Competitor performance.
    - Refer to `get_competitor_performance`.
  - Daily citations.
    - Refer to `get_daily_citations`.
- Data shaping: list fields collapsed with a stable delimiter; `citations` serialized to JSON.
  - Refer to `flatten_response`.
- Incremental syncs: dataset-specific checkpoints with rolling lookbacks.
  - Refer to `update` plus each helper's `op.checkpoint(...)`.

## Configuration file
Detail the configuration keys defined for your connector, which are uploaded to Fivetran from the `configuration.json` file.
```
{
  "api_token": "<your_api_token>", 
  "brand_id": "<specific_brand_id>"
}
```
- `api_token`: The Bearer token required for API authentication.
- `brand_id`: The specific brand identifier to filter data from Scrunch AI.

Note: The `brand_id` is a value that you will be getting directly from Scrunch AI.
Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
Explain the role of the `requirements.txt` file in specifying the Python libraries required by the connector.

*Example content of `requirements.txt`:*
python-dotenv==1.1.1 python_dateutil==2.9.0.post0

- `python-dotenv==1.1.1` is required to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `python_dateutil==2.9.0.post0` is needed to calculate rolling lookback windows.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
- type: Bearer token.
- header: `authorization: bearer <api_token>` (provided via `configuration["api_token"]`).
- where set: All `requests.get(...)` calls across helpers set this header.

You can get the API token directly from Scrunch AI.

## Pagination
The `get_all_responses` function handles pagination.

- The function loops while the `offset` is less than the `total` number of responses.
- Each page of responses is retrieved and flattened.
- These flattened items are **upserted** into the "responses" table using `op.upsert(table="responses", data=...)`.
- The example code advances the **offset** in increments of 100, relying on the API's default page size.
- Refer to `get_all_responses` and `get_responses` for details.

## Data handling
- Schema definition: `schema(configuration)` returns four tables:
  - `responses` (primary key: `id`).
  - `overall_scrunch_performance`.
  - `competitor_performance`.
  - `daily_citations`.

- Flattening: `flatten_response` transforms data for destination compatibility:
  - Preserves scalar fields.
  - Converts lists to delimited strings using `LIST_JOINER = " | "`.
  - Serializes `citations` to a JSON string (`citations_json`) to retain structure without array types.

- Aggregates: Each aggregate helper builds `fields`/`group_by` and upserts rows as returned by the API; no additional type casting is performed in this example.

- Upserts: All writes use `op.upsert(...)`.

## Error handling
- HTTP errors: `response.raise_for_status()` is called on all requests to surface API errors immediately.
- Config validation: Early failure if the `api_token` is missing in configuration.
- Operational logging: Progress prints every 100 upserts in aggregate loaders.

## Tables created

Summary of tables replicated.

### responses
- primary key: `id`.
- selected columns (not exhaustive): `id`, `created_at`, `prompt_id`, `prompt`, `persona_id`, `persona_name`, `country`, `stage`, `branded`, `platform`, `brand_present`, `brand_sentiment`, `brand_position`, `response_text`, `tags`, `key_topics`, `competitors_present`, `citations_json`.

### overall\_scrunch\_performance
- dimensions: `date`, `date_week`, `date_month`, `date_year`, `prompt_id`, `prompt`, `persona_id`, `persona_name`, `ai_platform`, `branded`.
- metrics: `responses`, `brand_presence_percentage`, `brand_position_score`, `brand_sentiment_score`, `competitor_presence_percentage`.

### competitor\_performance
- dimensions: `date`, `date_week`, `date_month`, `date_year`, `prompt_id`, `prompt`, `ai_platform`, `competitor_id`, `competitor_name`.

## Additional files
- `connector.py` – Contains all the core logic, including `schema`, `update`, `get_all_responses`, and all helper functions (`get_responses`, `flatten_response`, `get_scrunch_performance`, `get_competitor_performance`, `get_daily_citations`).
- `configuration.json` – The file used for connector configuration, including `api_token` and `brand_id`.
- `requirements.txt` – Specifies required third-party Python libraries (`python-dotenv`, `python_dateutil`).
