# Sensor Tower Connector SDK Example

This example demonstrates how to build a Fivetran Connector SDK integration for [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com), a market intelligence and analytics platform that provides insights into mobile apps, app store trends, and digital advertising. The connector pulls data from the Sensor Tower API for three tables: `SALES_REPORT_ESTIMATES`, `ACTIVE_USERS`, and `RETENTION`. You can configure the connector to track specific iOS and Android app IDs to gather the necessary information for your use case.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Supports three Sensor Tower endpoints: `SALES_REPORT_ESTIMATES`, `ACTIVE_USERS`, and `RETENTION` (see `ENDPOINTS` in `connector.py`)
* Handles both iOS and Android app IDs (see `IOS_APP_IDS` and `ANDROID_APP_IDS`)
* Incremental syncs with configurable lookback window (see `update` function)
* Schema mapping and column renaming for clarity (see `key_mapping` and `process_sales_report`)
* Modular data processing for each endpoint (see `process_active_users`, `process_sales_report`, and `process_retention`)

## Configuration file

The connector expects a `configuration.json` file with the following structure:

```
{
  "auth_token": "YOUR_SENSOR_TOWER_API_TOKEN"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies any additional Python libraries required by the connector. For this example, no extra dependencies are required beyond the Fivetran environment defaults.

*Example content of `requirements.txt`:*

```
requests
dateutil
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector requires a Sensor Tower API token for authentication. Obtain an API token from your Sensor Tower account dashboard. You should provide the token in the `configuration.json` file as the value for the `auth_token` key. (See `update` function in `connector.py`)

## Pagination

This example does not implement explicit pagination because the Sensor Tower API endpoints the example connector communicates with either return all requested data in a single response or are filtered by date range and country. (See `get_data` function)

## Data handling

* Data is retrieved from the Sensor Tower API using the `get_data` function.
* Each endpoint is processed by a dedicated function:
  * `process_active_users` (see lines ~90-102)
  * `process_sales_report` (see lines ~104-115)
  * `process_retention` (see lines ~117-129)
* Data is mapped and transformed as needed (e.g., column renaming for `sales_report_estimates` via `key_mapping`).
* All records are delivered to Fivetran using the `op.upsert` operation.
* The schema is defined in the `schema` function (see lines ~44-66).

## Error handling

This example does not implement custom error handling. Any HTTP or API errors will raise exceptions via the `requests` library. (See `get_data` function)

## Tables created

* `sales_report_estimates` – Contains app sales and revenue estimates by date and country.
* `active_users` – Tracks active user counts by app, date, time period, and country.
* `retention` – Provides retention metrics by app, date, and country.

*Sample data structure:*

| App ID | Date       | Country Code | iPhone Downloads | iPhone Revenue | ... |
|--------|------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|-----|
| 123456 | 2024-05-01 | US           | 1000             | 5000          | ... |

## Additional files

This example does not include additional files beyond the main connector script and configuration.
