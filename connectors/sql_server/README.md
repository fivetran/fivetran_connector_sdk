# SQL Server Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database using `pyodbc` and the Fivetran Connector SDK. It retrieves records from the `EMPLOYEE_DETAILS` table and syncs only those that have changed since the last run, using the `updated_time` column for incremental replication.

This example covers:
- SQL Server authentication via ODBC.
- Full table schema definition with primary keys.
- Date-based incremental sync logic.
- Batched reads using `fetchmany()`.
- State checkpointing after each run.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to a SQL Server database using `pyodbc`.
- Defines a static schema using the `schema()` method.
- Uses `updated_time` to identify records modified since the last sync.
- Supports batched record processing using `fetchmany()`.
- Emits each row with `op.upsert()` and saves progress with `op.checkpoint()`.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "driver": "YOUR_ODBC_DRIVER_LIKE='{ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server}'",
  "server": "YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS_LIKE='tcp:sql_test.database.windows.net,1433'",
  "database": "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME",
  "user": "YOUR_USERNAME",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
pyodbc
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Authentication is handled via the SQL Server username and password specified in the configuration.


## Pagination
The connector uses cursor-based pagination via the `updated_time` column. Batching is implemented using `cursor.fetchmany(batch_size)`. This allows large datasets to be processed incrementally and avoids loading the full result set into memory.


## Data handling
- The connector only syncs records where `updated_time > last_checkpoint_time`.
- All fields are explicitly mapped in the schema.
- `hire_date` and `updated_time` are converted to the appropriate formats for sync.
- Sync state is updated to the latest `updated_time` seen in the batch.


## Error handling
- Database connection errors are caught and logged with descriptive messages.
- Queries are validated before execution.
- Connections and cursors are closed safely with `try/finally` blocks.
- State is checkpointed even if only partial sync is completed.


## Tables created
The connector creates an `EMPLOYEE_DETAILS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "employee_details",
  "primary_key": ["employee_id"],
  "columns": {
    "employee_id": "INT",
    "first_name": "STRING",
    "last_name": "STRING",
    "hire_date": "NAIVE_DATE",
    "salary": "LONG",
    "updated_time": "NAIVE_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
