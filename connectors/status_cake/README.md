# StatusCake Uptime Monitoring Connector Example


## Connector overview
This connector fetches uptime monitoring data from [StatusCake](https://app.statuscake.com/), a website monitoring service. It extracts uptime test configurations, historical performance data, downtime periods, and alert information to provide comprehensive monitoring insights. The connector integrates with StatusCake's API to pull data for all configured uptime tests and their associated monitoring metrics, enabling users to analyze website performance and reliability trends in their data warehouse.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
    - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
    - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
    - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Fetches all uptime test configurations and metadata
- Retrieves historical performance data with response times and status codes
- Collects downtime period information with start/end times and duration
- Extracts alert history with trigger timestamps and status details
- Handles API rate limiting with automatic retry logic
- Flattens nested JSON structures for optimal data warehouse storage
- Supports full data refresh on each sync 


## Configuration file
The configuration requires your StatusCake API key for authentication. You can obtain this from your StatusCake account dashboard under API settings.

```json
{
  "api_key": "<YOUR_STATUS_CAKE_API_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
The `requirements.txt` file specifies additional Python libraries required by the connector. Following Fivetran best practices, this connector doesn't require additional dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
The connector uses Bearer token authentication with StatusCake's API. You need to provide your API key in the configuration file. To obtain an API key:

1. Log into your StatusCake account.
2. Navigate to **Account Settings â†’ API Keys**.
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one.
4. Add the key to your `configuration.json` file as shown above.


## Data handling
The connector processes data from four main StatusCake API endpoints and flattens complex nested structures into relational table format. Each API response is parsed and nested objects are flattened using underscore notation. Arrays are converted to comma-separated strings for easier analysis. All data is upserted to ensure the latest information is always available.


## Error handling
The connector implements comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures. API rate limiting (HTTP 429) is handled with automatic delays, and connection errors are retried up to 3 times with increasing delay intervals.


## Tables created
The connector creates four tables to store different aspects of StatusCake monitoring data:

- **UPTIME_TEST** - Core uptime test configurations and current status information
- **UPTIME_TEST_HISTORY** - Historical performance data with response times and status codes
- **UPTIME_TEST_PERIOD** - Downtime and uptime period records with durations
- **UPTIME_TEST_ALERT** - Alert notifications with trigger times and status changes
