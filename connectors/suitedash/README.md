# SuiteDash CRM Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example shows how to use Connector SDK to extracts companies, contacts, and their relationships data from the [SuiteDash CRM](https://app.suitedash.com/secure-api), handling proper data flattening and pagination. It's designed for organizations using SuiteDash CRM who want to analyze their customer and prospect data in their data warehouse.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
    - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
    - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
    - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- **Companies sync**: Extracts all company records from the `/companies` endpoint.
- **Contacts sync**: Extracts all contact records from the `/contacts` endpoint.
- **Relationship mapping**: Creates a separate table for contact-company relationships data.
- **Data flattening**: Flattens nested JSON objects (primaryContact, category, address) into flat table columns.
- **Array handling**: Converts tags and circles arrays to comma-separated strings.
- **Pagination support**: Handles SuiteDash's next-page-URL pagination automatically.
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling for API failures and network issues.


## Configuration file
The configuration file defines the authentication credentials required to connect to the SuiteDash API.

```json
{
  "public_id": "<YOUR_SUITEDASH_PUBLIC_ID>",
  "secret_key": "<YOUR_SUITEDASH_SECRET_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
The requirements.txt file specifies additional Python libraries required by the connector. Following Fivetran best practices, this connector doesn't require additional dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
The connector uses SuiteDash's secure API authentication mechanism which requires:
- `X-Public-ID`: Your SuiteDash account public ID (UUID format)
- `X-Secret-Key`: Your SuiteDash secret key

To obtain these credentials:
1. Log into your SuiteDash account.
2. Navigate to **Account Settings** > **API Settings**.
3. Generate or copy your Public ID and Secret Key.
4. Configure these values in your `configuration.json` file.


## Pagination
The connector handles SuiteDash's pagination using the next-page-URL mechanism. The API returns pagination metadata in the response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "pageSize": 10,
      "totalPages": 2,
      "totalItems": 15,
      "currentPageNumber": 1,
      "previousPage": null,
      "nextPage": "https://app.suitedash.com/secure-api/companies?page=2"
    }
  }
}
```

The pagination logic is implemented in the `sync_endpoint_with_pagination()` function.


## Data handling
The connector processes and transforms SuiteDash data as follows:

**Data flattening**: Nested objects are flattened using the `flatten_nested_object()` function:
- `primaryContact` → `primaryContact_uid`, `primaryContact_first_name`, etc.
- `category` → `category_name`, `category_color`, `category_isDefault`
- `address` → `address_address_line_1`, `address_city`, `address_state`, etc.

**Array processing**:
- `tags` arrays are converted to comma-separated strings
- `circles` arrays are converted to comma-separated strings
- `companies` arrays in contacts create separate relationship records

**Data types**: The connector lets Fivetran infer data types automatically, only defining primary keys in the schema.


## Error handling
Error handling is implemented throughout the connector:
- **Configuration validation**: The `validate_configuration()` function ensures required credentials are present
- **API request handling**: The `make_api_request()` function catches HTTP errors and network issues
- **Exception propagation**: All functions raise `RuntimeError` with descriptive messages for upstream handling


## Tables created

The connector creates the following tables in your destination:

| Table name                      | Primary key                  | Description |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| `COMPANIES`                     | `uid`                        | Contains flattened company data from the `/companies` endpoint |
| `CONTACTS`                      | `uid`                        | Contains flattened contact data from the `/contacts` endpoint |
| `CONTACT_COMPANY_RELATIONSHIPS` | `contact_uid`, `company_uid` | Junction table mapping contacts to their associated companies |
