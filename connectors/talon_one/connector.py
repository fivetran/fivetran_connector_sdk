"""
This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
The code will retrieve data for specific endpoints from Talon.one and create one table per endpoint
Tables and endpoints defined at the top of the script in table_endpoint_list
You will need to provide your own Talon.one credentials for this to work --> "base_url" and "api_key" in configuration.json
You can also define how far back in history to go on initial sync using the "initial_sync_start_date" in configuration.json
Relevant Talon.one API documentation: https://docs.talon.one/management-api#tag/Customer-data/operation/getApplicationEventsWithoutTotalCount
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
