# Temporal Cloud Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector syncs workflow and schedule data from Temporal Cloud to Fivetran. Temporal Cloud is a managed service for running Temporal workflows, which are durable, scalable, and fault-tolerant distributed applications. This connector retrieves workflow execution history and schedule configurations from your Temporal namespace, allowing you to analyze workflow performance, monitor execution patterns, and track schedule configurations in your data warehouse.

The connector fetches two main types of data:
- Workflow executions: Including workflow metadata, execution status, timing information, task queues, execution duration, and search attributes
- Schedules: Including schedule specifications (cron expressions, intervals, calendar-based schedules), next action times, recent execution history, workflow actions to be triggered, and schedule state (paused/active)

This enables use cases such as workflow performance analysis, execution monitoring, schedule audit trails, and operational insights into your Temporal Cloud applications.


## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features

- Extracts all workflow executions from your Temporal namespace
- Retrieves complete schedule configurations 
- Calculates workflow execution duration in seconds
- Captures workflow metadata including status, task queue, and search attributes
- Extracts schedule specifications including cron expressions, intervals, and calendar-based schedules
- Tracks schedule state (paused/active) and recent execution history
- Implements async operations for efficient data retrieval
- Uses streaming approach to handle large datasets without memory overflow
- Provides progress logging for monitoring long-running syncs
- Timezone-aware timestamp handling for accurate time tracking


## Configuration file

The connector requires three configuration parameters to connect to your Temporal Cloud account:

```json
{
  "temporal_host": "your-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233",
  "temporal_namespace": "your-namespace-id",
  "temporal_api_key": "your-api-key"
}
```

Configuration parameters:
- `temporal_host` – Your Temporal Cloud host address in the format `namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233`
- `temporal_namespace` – Your Temporal namespace identifier
- `temporal_api_key` – API key for authenticating with Temporal Cloud

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file

The connector requires the Temporal Python SDK for connecting to Temporal Cloud:

```
temporalio==1.22.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication

The connector uses API key authentication to access Temporal Cloud. To obtain the necessary credentials:

1. Log in to your Temporal Cloud account at https://cloud.temporal.io

2. Navigate to your namespace settings.

3. Generate an API key with read permissions for workflows and schedules.

4. Copy the API key and your namespace details.

5. Add these credentials to your `configuration.json` file.

The API key is passed securely via the TLS connection to Temporal Cloud. Configuration validation is performed by the `validate_configuration` function at the start of each sync.


## Pagination

The connector uses Temporal Cloud's native async iteration to handle large datasets efficiently. Both workflows and schedules are retrieved using async generators:

- Workflow pagination: The `fetch_temporal_workflows` function uses `client.list_workflows()` which returns an async iterator. Workflows are processed one at a time without loading all data into memory.
- Schedule pagination: The `fetch_temporal_schedules` function uses `client.list_schedules()` which returns an async iterator for streaming schedule data.

Progress is logged at regular intervals:
- Every 100 workflows processed
- Every 50 schedules processed

This streaming approach ensures the connector can handle namespaces with thousands of workflows and schedules without memory overflow issues.


## Data handling

The connector implements several helper functions to extract and transform data from Temporal Cloud objects. Refer to `connector.py` for implementation details.

Workflow data processing:
- `_calculate_execution_time` – Calculates workflow execution duration in seconds from start and close timestamps
- `_build_workflow_data` – Transforms Temporal workflow objects into structured dictionaries for destination tables

Schedule data processing:
- `_extract_next_action_times` – Extracts upcoming execution times from schedule info
- `_extract_recent_actions` – Retrieves recent execution history with scheduled and actual times
- `_extract_schedule_spec` – Extracts schedule specifications including cron expressions, intervals, calendar settings, and timezone information
- `_extract_schedule_action` – Retrieves workflow action details that will be triggered by the schedule
- `_extract_schedule_state` – Extracts schedule state including paused status and notes
- `_build_schedule_data` – Orchestrates all schedule data extraction into a complete record

All timestamps are converted to ISO 8601 format with timezone awareness using `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. The connector uses the upsert operation to insert or update records in destination tables, ensuring idempotent syncs.


## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies. Refer to `connector.py` for implementation details.

Configuration validation:
- The `validate_configuration` function verifies that all required parameters (temporal_host, temporal_namespace, temporal_api_key) are present before attempting connection
- Raises descriptive ValueError messages for missing configuration

Connection errors:
- Both `fetch_temporal_workflows` and `fetch_temporal_schedules` functions catch and log connection failures
- ValueError exceptions are caught separately for configuration issues
- Generic Exception handling logs errors and re-raises them for Fivetran to handle

Main sync errors:
- The `update` function wraps all operations in a try-except block
- Exceptions are caught, logged, and re-raised with descriptive messages
- Ensures failed syncs are properly reported to Fivetran

The connector follows best practices by catching specific exceptions where possible and providing detailed error messages for troubleshooting.


## Tables created
