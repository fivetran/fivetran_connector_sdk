# Toast Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector extracts and syncs data from the [Toast POS API](https://doc.toasttab.com/) into a destination warehouse. Toast is a restaurant management platform providing point-of-sale, labor, menu, and operational data.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Syncs data from multiple Toast endpoints, including orders, employees, shifts, menus, and more
- Automatically handles nested JSON structures and normalizes them into relational tables
- Includes incremental sync via time-based windowing and state checkpointing
- Graceful handling of rate limits, authentication, and API errors
- Supports voids, deletions, and nested child entities
- Uses Fernet encryption for token security in state

## Configuration file

```json
{
  "clientId": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
  "clientSecret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "userAccessType": "<TOAST_MACHINE_CLIENT>",
  "domain": "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
  "initialSyncStart": "<ISO_FORMAT_TIMESTAMP>",
  "key": "<BASE_64_ENCODED_FERNET_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Authentication

The connector generates and caches a Toast access token using the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `userAccessType` credentials. The token is encrypted using the provided Fernet `key` and stored in state for reuse across syncs. For more information on Fernet encryption, see the [Fernet documentation](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/). Refer to `make_headers(configuration, base_url, state, key)`.

## Pagination

The connector syncs data in 30-day time windows, iterating from `initialSyncStart` to the current sync time. State is checkpointed after each window to allow resumption in case of interruption. Refer to `sync_items(base_url, headers, ts_from, ts_to, start_timestamp, state)` and `set_timeranges(state, configuration, start_timestamp)`.

## Data handling

- The connector flattens nested JSON objects and serializes list fields using `flatten_dict(parent_row, dict_field, prefix)`, `extract_fields(fields, row)`, and `stringify_lists(d)`.
- Records are written to the destination using `op.upsert()`, and deleted records are emitted using `op.delete()`. 
- State is updated after each 30-day window to enable incremental sync. Refer to `sync_items(base_url, headers, ts_from, ts_to, start_timestamp, state)`.
- Checkpointing: Updates state after each window to resume seamlessly


## Error handling

- 401 Unauthorized – Retries up to three times before logging a severe error and skipping the endpoint.
- 403 Forbidden – Skips the endpoint.
- 429 Too Many Requests – Backs off on rate limit response before retrying.
- 400 and 409 errors – Skips with logging.

## Tables created

The entity-relationship diagram (ERD) below shows how tables are linked in the Toast schema.

### Core tables
- `restaurant`
- `job`, `employee`, `shift`, `break`, `time_entry`
- `orders`, `orders_check`, `payment`

### Configuration
- `menu`, `menu_item`, `menu_group`, `discounts`, `tables`, etc.

### Nested children
- `orders_check_payment`, `orders_check_selection`, `orders_check_selection_modifier`, etc.

### Cash management
- `cash_entry`, `cash_deposit`
