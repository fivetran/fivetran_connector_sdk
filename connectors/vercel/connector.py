"""Vercel Deployments Connector for Fivetran - fetches deployment data from Vercel /v6/deployments API.
This connector demonstrates how to fetch deployment data from Vercel REST API /v6/deployments endpoint and upsert it into destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK.
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details
