The connector securely establishes an SSH session to a remote EC2 instance running the fivetran-api-playground server and facilitates data interaction over the SSH Tunnel. This setup uses passwords for authentication.
- [using_bastion_server](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/ssh_tunnels/using_bastion_server) - This example shows how to connect to a database server behind a bastion server using SSH tunneling. It uses the `sshtunnel` library to create an SSH tunnel and `psycopg2-binary` to connect to a PostgreSQL database through the tunnel.
