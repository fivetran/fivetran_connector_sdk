# API Key Auth Connector Example

## Connector overview
This is a simple example that demonstrates how to implement API key authentication with a REST API using the Fivetran Connector SDK. The connector retrieves user records from a mock API and upserts them into a table named `USER`. It illustrates core concepts such as schema definition, data sync via the update method, state checkpointing, and API request handling using the `requests` library.

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Demonstrates API key authentication pattern.
- Retrieves user data from a mock API using `requests`.
- Implements the update method to upsert rows into the `USER` table.
- Uses checkpointing to persist sync state.
- Suitable for understanding SDK fundamentals and debugging connector behavior locally.

## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters: 

```
{
  "api_key": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
Authentication is handled via an API key, which is sent in the `Authorization` header of each API request.
Example:
`Authorization: apiKey <YOUR_API_KEY>`

## Pagination
This connector retrieves all data in a single request (no pagination). If extending to a paginated API, modify the `sync_items()` function to loop through pages using cursor tokens or offsets.

## Data handling
- Data is retrieved from a mock REST API endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/auth/api_key`.
- The `sync_items()` function sends a GET request and reads the JSON payload.
- Each user object is passed to `op.upsert()` for syncing to Fivetran.
- The state object is checkpointed at the end of each sync for incremental syncs in the future.

## Error handling
- Missing API key in configuration raises a ValueError.
- HTTP errors are raised via `response.raise_for_status()` in `get_api_response()`.
- Logging is handled via `fivetran_connector_sdk.Logging`.

## Tables created
The connector creates the `USER` table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
