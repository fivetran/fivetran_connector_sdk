# HTTP Basic Auth Connector Example

## Connector overview
This is a simple example that demonstrates how to implement HTTP basic authentication with a REST API using the Fivetran Connector SDK. The connector fetches user records from a mock API and upserts them into a table named `USER`. It serves as a learning resource for implementing HTTP Basic Auth, schema management, state checkpointing, and syncing data to Fivetran destinations.

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Demonstrates how to use HTTP basic authentication.
- Retrieves mock user data using the `requests` library.
- Defines a `schema()` function to register Fivetran-compatible output.
- Uses the `update()` method to process and upsert rows.
- Saves sync state to support incremental or resumable runs.

## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters: 

```
{
  "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
This connector authenticates using HTTP basic auth. The credentials (username and password) are base64-encoded and passed in the `Authorization` header of each API request.
Example:
`Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>`

## Pagination
This connector retrieves all data in a single request (no pagination). If extending to a paginated API, modify the `sync_items()` function to loop through pages using cursor tokens or offsets.

## Data handling
- The connector calls a mock endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/auth/http_basic`.
- Data returned from the API is processed in `sync_items()`, and then each user object is passed to `op.upsert()` for syncing to Fivetran.
- After all items are processed, the current state is saved using `op.checkpoint()` to support future incremental syncs.

## Error handling
- If authentication fields (username or password) are missing, `get_auth_headers()` raises a ValueError.
- HTTP errors are caught via `raise_for_status()` in the `get_api_response()` function.
- Logging is done using the `fivetran_connector_sdk.Logging` module.

## Tables created
The connector creates one table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
