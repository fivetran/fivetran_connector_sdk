# **Azure Key Vault for Secret Management**

**Connector Overview**

This connector demonstrates how to use Azure Key Vault to securely manage database credentials. It retrieves credentials from Azure Key Vault, connects to a database, fetches data from database and upserts the data. 

## **Requirements**

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating System:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later

## **Getting Started**

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## **Features**

- Securely retrieves database credentials from Azure Key Vault
- Connects to the PostgreSQL database using retrieved credentials
- Verifies the connection by executing a simple query
- Upserts a record into a table to confirm successful connection

## **Configuration File**

The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```
{
  "tenant_id": "<YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID>",
  "client_id": "<YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<YOUR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "vault_url": "<https://YOUR-VAULT-NAME.vault.azure.net/>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## **Requirements File**

This connector requires Azure SDK packages to access Key Vault and connect to PostgreSQL:

```
psycopg2-binary
azure-identity
azure-keyvault
azure-storage==0.36.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## **Authentication**

This connector uses service principal authentication to access Azure Key Vault. To create the necessary credentials:  
1. Register an application in Azure Active Directory  
   - Go to Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
   - Create a new registration with a name of your choice
   - Note the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID
2. Create a client secret  
   - In your app registration, go to Certificates & secrets
   - Create a new client secret and note its value immediately
3. Grant the application access to your Key Vault  
   - For role-based access control: Go to Key Vault → Access control (IAM) → Add role assignment
   - Assign the "Key Vault Secrets User" role to your application
   - For access policy: Go to Key Vault → Access policies → Add access policy
   - Grant "Get" and "List" permissions for secrets to your application


## **Data Handling**

The connector retrieves credentials from Azure Key Vault and uses them to establish a database connection. It then:  

1. Executes a simple query to verify connectivity and retrieve data from a table in the database.

2. Upserts the data in the `employees` table.
   
The connector expects the following secrets to be stored in the Key Vault:  
   - postgresHost
   - postgresPort
   - postgresDatabase
   - postgresUser
   - postgresPassword

## **Tables Created**
The connector creates the following table in the database:
- `employees` - This table is used to store employee data. The schema includes:
  - id (INT)
  - name (STRING)
  - department_id (INT)
  - employee_metadata (JSON)

The table in the destination looks like this:

| id | name      | department_id | employee_metadata    | _fivetran_deleted | _fivetran_synced              |
|----|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1  | John Doe  | 1             | {"role": "Engineer"} | false             | 2025-05-11 19:53:33.959 +0000 |
| 2  | Berry Doe | 1             | {"role": "Engineer"} | false             | 2025-05-11 19:53:33.984 +0000 |
