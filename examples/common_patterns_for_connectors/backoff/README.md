# Connector SDK Backoff Strategies Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates retry and backoff handling for a paginated REST API endpoint using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It uses [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) as the mock source.

The connector supports these retry strategies through the `backoff_strategy` field in `configuration.json`:

- `fixed`: waits the same number of seconds before every retry.
- `linear`: increases the wait time by a fixed amount on each retry.
- `exponential`: doubles the wait time on each retry.
- `exponential_with_cap`: uses exponential growth but limits the maximum wait time.
- `exponential_with_jitter`: uses a randomized exponential wait to reduce synchronized retries.
- `retry_after`: honors the source API's `Retry-After` header when present and falls back to capped exponential backoff.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```bash
fivetran init <project-path> --template examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/backoff
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`.
If you do not specify a project path, Fivetran creates the project in your current directory.
For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide#createyourcustomconnector).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.

To run this example with visible rate limiting behavior in `fivetran-api-playground`, start the source API with:

```bash
playground start --rate-limit --capacity 1
```

## Features

- Configurable backoff strategy (`backoff_strategy`).
- Retries network and timeout exceptions.
- Retries HTTP `429` (rate limit).
- Retries HTTP `5xx` server errors.
- Non-retry behavior for HTTP `4xx` client errors (except `429`).
- Frequent checkpointing for safe resume behavior.

## Configuration file

Use `configuration.json`:

```json
{
  "backoff_strategy": "<YOUR_BACKOFF_STRATEGY>",
  "api_url": "<YOUR_API_URL>"
}
```

Fields:

- `backoff_strategy`: one of `fixed`, `linear`, `exponential`, `exponential_with_cap`, `exponential_with_jitter`, `retry_after`.
- `api_url`: full API endpoint URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:5001/pagination/next_page_url`.

> Note: When submitting connector code as a [Community Connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/connectors) or enhancing an [example](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples) in the open-source [Connector SDK repository](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main), ensure the `configuration.json` file has placeholder values.
When adding the connector to your production repository, ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

This example does not require `requirements.txt`.

> Note: [Some packages](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/technical-reference#preinstalledpackages) are pre-installed in the Connector SDK runtime environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`. 

## Authentication

No authentication is required for this endpoint in `fivetran-api-playground`.

## Pagination

Pagination uses the `next_page_url` value returned by each response page.

Behavior:

1. Request first page with query params (`updated_since`, sort order, `per_page`).
2. Upsert current page items.
3. Move to `next_page_url` when present.
4. Stop when page has no data or no `next_page_url`.

Refer to the `sync_items` and `get_api_response` functions in `connector.py` .

## Data handling

- Destination table: `USER`
- Primary key: `id`
- State key: `last_updated_at`
- Checkpointing after every page.
- Checkpointing after each checkpoint interval.

Refer to the `schema` and `sync_items` functions in `connector.py`.

## Error handling

Retry logic is applied with a max retry cap:

- `__MAX_RETRIES = 5`
- `__REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 10`

Backoff behavior by category:

- `429`: retries using configured strategy and `Retry-After` header when strategy is `retry_after`.
- `5xx`: retries using configured strategy.
- Request exceptions (connection/timeouts): retries using configured strategy.
- Non-`429` `4xx`: fails immediately as non-retryable.

Refer to the `validate_configuration`, `compute_delay`, and `get_api_response` functions in `connector.py.

## Tables created

- `USER`

Columns:

- `id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `address`
- `company`
- `job`
- `updatedAt`
- `createdAt`
