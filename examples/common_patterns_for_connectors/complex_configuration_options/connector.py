"""
This is an example to show how to handle complex configuration options in your connector code.
It shows multiple ways to cast configuration fields to list, integer, boolean and dict for use in connector code.
It also shows how to define static configuration values in a separate file and import them into your connector.
It also highlights how you can define constant values in the connector code as well.
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.
