# Complex Error Handling with Multithreading Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to implement next-page URL-based pagination for REST APIs with multithreading and comprehensive error handling strategies. The connector fetches records from a paginated API, processes them in parallel using multiple threads, and implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability and resilience.

This example combines three important patterns:
- Pagination: Uses next-page URL pagination to fetch all records from the API
- Multithreading: Processes records in parallel for improved performance
- Error Handling: Implements circuit breaker, retry logic, error categorization, and graceful degradation

This pagination and multithreading strategy is useful when:
- The API includes the full URL for the next page in each response
- You need to process large volumes of data efficiently
- You want to build resilient connectors that handle transient failures gracefully
- You need detailed error tracking and monitoring capabilities

Note: This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features

### Pagination
- Handles `next_page_url` pagination logic
- Tracks sync position using the `updatedAt` timestamp
- Automatically follows next-page links across paginated API responses
- Uses `op.checkpoint()` to safely store progress after each page

### Multithreading
- Processes records in parallel using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for improved performance
- Supports a configurable number of worker threads (default: 4, recommended: 4-8)
- Offers thread-safe state management with proper locking mechanisms
- Efficiently utilizes resources with bounded thread pools

### Comprehensive error handling
- Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents cascading failures by opening the circuit when too many errors occur
- Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff: Automatically retries failed requests with increasing wait times
- Error Categorization: Tracks different types of errors (timeouts, connection errors, rate limits, validation errors)
- Graceful Degradation: Individual record failures don't stop the entire sync
- Rate Limit Handling: Respects API rate limits with proper backoff
- Thread-Safe Error Statistics: Collects and reports error metrics across all threads
- Timeout Protection: Prevents hanging requests with configurable timeouts
- Data Validation: Validates required fields before processing


## Configuration file
This example supports optional configuration for parallelism:

```json
{
  "parallelism": 4
}
```
Configuration parameter:
- `parallelism`: Number of worker threads to use for parallel processing (optional, defaults to 4)

For production connectors, `configuration.json` might also contain API tokens, initial cursors, or filters to narrow down API results.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires no extra Python dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not use authentication.

In real-world scenarios, modify `get_api_response()` to add `Authorization` headers or include API keys in query parameters.


## Pagination
Pagination is based on the `next_page_url` key provided in the API response:
```json
{
  "data": [],
  "next_page_url": "https://api.example.com/page=2"
}
```
- The initial request includes `updated_since`, `order_by`, and `per_page`
- If `next_page_url` is present, it is used as the next request's endpoint
- Query parameters are cleared because they're already embedded in the `next_page_url`
- Pages are fetched sequentially to maintain order, but records within each page are processed in parallel

Pagination continues until no `next_page_url` is returned.


## Multithreading architecture

### Thread pool configuration
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` with configurable worker threads
- Default: 4 workers (recommended: 4-8 for production)
- Each page of records is processed in parallel
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking

### Processing flow
1. Page Fetching: Pages are fetched sequentially to maintain order
2. Parallel Processing: Records within each page are processed concurrently
3. State Management: Thread-safe state updates ensure consistency
4. Error Isolation: Individual record failures don't affect other records

### Thread safety considerations
- `processing_lock`: Protects state dictionary updates
- `error_stats_lock`: Protects error statistics tracking
- Circuit breaker has internal locking for state management
- SDK operations (upsert, checkpoint) are thread-safe by design


## Error handling

### 1. Circuit breaker pattern
The connector implements a circuit breaker with three states:
- Closed (normal): Requests flow through normally
- Open (failed): Too many errors detected, requests blocked temporarily
- Half-Open (testing): Testing if service has recovered

Configuration:
- Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures trigger circuit opening
- Timeout: 60 seconds before attempting recovery

### 2. Retry logic with exponential backoff
Failed requests are automatically retried with increasing wait times:
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: Wait 1 second
- Attempt 3: Wait 2 seconds
- Attempt 4: Wait 4 seconds

### 3. Error categorization
The connector tracks and reports different error types:
- Timeout Errors: Request took too long to complete
- Connection Errors: Network connectivity issues
- Rate Limit Errors: API rate limits exceeded (429 status)
- Server Errors: API server issues (5xx status)
- Client Errors: Request errors (4xx status except 429)
- Validation Errors: Data validation failures
- Processing Errors: Errors during record processing
- Fatal Page Errors: Unrecoverable page-level errors

### 4. Rate limit handling
Special handling for HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests):
- Respects `Retry-After` header from API
- Default wait time: 60 seconds if header not present
- Automatic retry after waiting

### 5. Graceful degradation
- Individual record failures are logged but don't stop the sync
- Page-level errors are retried with backoff
- Failed records are tracked in error statistics
- Sync continues processing other records

### 6. Data validation
Each record is validated before processing:
- Required field checks (id, updatedAt)
- Type validation
- Validation errors are categorized separately

### 7. Timeout protection
All API requests have a 30-second timeout to prevent hanging:
- Prevents infinite waiting
- Triggers retry logic on timeout
- Tracked in timeout error statistics


## Data handling
- The connector fetches user records from each page sequentially
- Records within each page are processed in parallel using thread pool
- Each record is validated before processing
- Each row is passed to `op.upsert()` for syncing into the `USER` table
- The `state["last_updated_at"]` field is updated with thread-safe locking
- `op.checkpoint()` is called after each page to persist the cursor


## Error reporting
At the end of each sync, the connector logs comprehensive error statistics:
```
Error Statistics Summary:
  timeout_errors: 3
  rate_limit_errors: 1
  failed_items: 5
  validation_errors: 2
```

This helps with:
- Monitoring connector health
- Identifying systemic issues
- Debugging failures
- Performance tuning


## Performance considerations

### Thread configuration
- Recommended: 4-8 worker threads for production
- Default: 4 workers (good balance for most use cases)
- Important: More threads ≠ better performance
  - Higher thread counts can increase overhead
  - May trigger rate limits more frequently
  - Can exhaust system resources

### Memory management
- Records are processed as they arrive (streaming)
- No large data structures held in memory
- Thread pool size bounds concurrent operations

### Checkpoint strategy
- State is checkpointed after each page
- Allows resuming from last successful page
- Minimizes data re-processing on failures


## Tables created
The connector creates the `USER` table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
