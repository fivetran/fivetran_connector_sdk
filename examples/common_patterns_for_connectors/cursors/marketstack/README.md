# Marketstack Stock Data Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to implement a cursor-based sync strategy using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It connects to the [Marketstack API](https://marketstack.com/documentation), retrieves historical stock price data for a predefined list of tickers, and upserts the results into a table named `TICKERS_PRICE`.
The connector tracks sync progress using a cursor-based state mechanism (`date_from`, `date_to`, and `ticker_offset`) to support resumable and incremental syncing. It is ideal for learning how to handle paginated, stateful data pipelines with external APIs.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to the [Marketstack API](https://marketstack.com/documentation) to fetch EOD stock data.
- Supports cursor-based incremental syncing using `date_from`, `date_to`, and `ticker_offset`.
- Fetches paginated results with offset handling (limit, offset).
- Provides robust error handling and logging for debugging failed syncs.
- Uses `schema()` and `update()` functions to define and execute the sync contract.
- Logs a summary of fetched data including ticker coverage and date range.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters: 

```
{
    "apiKey": "<YOUR_MARKETSTACK_API_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector uses a simple API key authentication mechanism. Your API key must be included as a query parameter in every request to the Marketstack API.

The API key is retrieved from the `configuration.json` file and passed as the `access_key` parameter in the request:
Example:
`GET /v1/eod?access_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>

You can obtain a free API key by signing up at [marketstack.com](https://marketstack.com/). Make sure your key is valid and has sufficient permissions for the endpoints being accessed.


## Pagination
Pagination is handled through the `limit` and `offset` parameters. The connector fetches up to 1000 records per request and continues retrieving data until the response contains no additional records.
The `offset` is incremented internally within the `get_ticker_price()` method, which accumulates all pages for a ticker before proceeding to the next.


## Data handling
The connector performs the following operations:
- State initialization: Initializes the cursor state with a date window (`start_cursor`, `end_cursor`) and a `ticker_offset`.
- Data fetching:
  - Iterates over a fixed set of tickers (`AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GOOG`, `INTC`). 
  - For each ticker, fetches all records in a date window using paginated requests. 
- Upserting: Syncs each record using `op.upsert()` into the `TICKERS_PRICE` table.
- Checkpointing: Saves the updated state using `op.checkpoint()` to resume from the correct ticker and date on the next run.


## Error handling
- HTTP errors are caught via `requests.exceptions.RequestException`.
- JSON parsing errors and missing keys are logged with descriptive RuntimeError messages.
- Unexpected exceptions are caught in `update()` and re-raised with full stack trace logs.
- A data summary is logged after each sync for auditing purposes.


## Tables created
The connector creates the `TICKERS_PRICE` table:

```
{
  "table": "tickers_price",
  "primary_key": ["symbol", "date"],
  "columns": {
     // Note: Columns are dynamically inferred from the Marketstack response. 
  }
}
```
