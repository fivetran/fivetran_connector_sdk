# Parent-Child Tables with Cursors Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to handle parent-child relationships between tables using incremental syncs with independent cursors per table. It simulates API calls for syncing company and department records and showcases how to manage per-entity cursors for nested data models.

Each company is incrementally synced based on its `updated_at` field, and for each company, the connector fetches and syncs its associated departments using a separate per-company cursor.

Note: This example uses hardcoded static data to simulate the API calls. It is intended for learning purposes and not for production use.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

  
## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates parent-child table syncs (company â†’ department).
- Maintains independent cursors:
  - Global cursor for companies (company_cursor)
  - Per-company cursors for departments (department_cursor[company_id])
- Supports incremental loading with `updated_at` tracking.
- Includes checkpointing after every upserted record to ensure safe resumption.
- Simulates API calls and response handling using static mock data.


## Configuration file
No external configuration is required for this connector.

In a real-life implementation, you would include authentication tokens, API URLs, or pagination parameters in your `configuration.json`.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This example uses hardcoded mock data and does not require authentication.

In a production scenario, API calls would include headers or credentials, and the `get_api_response()` function would handle token injection or OAuth flows.


## Pagination
This example does not include pagination. In real-world APIs:
- Company and department data may be paginated.
- You would implement pagination in `fetch_companies()` and `fetch_departments_for_company()` using query parameters like limit, offset, or cursor tokens.


## Data handling
The connector processes data as follows:
- Initializes `company_cursor` and `department_cursor` from the last checkpointed state.
- Fetches companies updated since `company_cursor`.
- For each company:
  - Sync data via `op.upsert()` to the `COMPANY` table. 
  - Updates and checkpoints the new `company_cursor`.
- For each company, fetches its departments using its specific cursor.
- For each department:
  - Sync data via `op.upsert()` to the `DEPARTMENT` table. 
  - Updates and checkpoints the `department_cursor[company_id]`.

This approach ensures fine-grained incremental syncing for nested entities.


## Error handling
- All API calls (mocked) log the request URL and parameters.
- In a real implementation, get_api_response() would raise exceptions on HTTP errors.
- Each checkpoint ensures partial progress is saved even if a later step fails.


## Tables created
The connector creates two tables:

`COMPANY`:

```
{
  "table": "company",
  "primary_key": ["company_id"],
  "columns": {
    "company_id": "STRING",
    "company_name": "STRING",
    "updated_at": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```

`DEPARTMENT`:

```
{
  "table": "department",
  "primary_key": ["department_id", "company_id"],
  "columns": {
    "department_id": "STRING",
    "company_id": "STRING",
    "department_name": "STRING",
    "updated_at": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
