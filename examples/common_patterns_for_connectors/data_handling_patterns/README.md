# Data handling patterns connector example
## Connector overview

This example demonstrates three common techniques for handling nested data structures returned by an API source. A single API call fetches all user records, and each of the three sync functions applies a different data handling pattern to the same response:

- Flatten into columns – when the source returns a single nested object alongside top-level fields, its fields are promoted to individual columns on the parent table.
- Break out into child tables – when the source returns a list of nested objects inside a parent record, each list item is written to a separate child table.
- Write as a JSON blob – when the source returns nested structures that may vary between records, the entire structure is stored as a single JSON column.


## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features

- Demonstrates three distinct data handling patterns for nested API responses in a single connector.
- Flattens all nested structures into a single flat table – refer to `sync_flattened()`.
- Splits a nested orders list into a parent table and a child table with a composite primary key – refer to `sync_parent_child()`.
- Stores the nested orders as a JSON blob column – refer to `sync_json_blob()`.
- Uses a mock API to simulate source data with randomized values and a fixed schema, enabling local testing without credentials or configuration.
- Checkpoints state after every table sync and at a configurable interval (`__CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`) to support safe resumption after interruptions.


## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python libraries required by the connector. 
This example uses the `faker` library in `mock_api.py` to randomize the values in the simulated source data during local testing.

```
faker==40.5.1
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication

This example does not use any authentication. It connects to a mock API (`mock_api.py`) that generates synthetic data locally. When building your own connector, replace the mock API calls with authenticated requests to your real data source.


## Pagination

This example does not implement pagination. The mock API returns all records in a single response. When building your own connector, add pagination if your source returns results across multiple pages. Refer to the [pagination examples](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/pagination) for common patterns such as offset-based, page-number, keyset, and next-page-URL pagination.


## Data handling

A single call to `get_users()` in `mock_api.py` returns a list of user records, each containing all nested structures. The three sync functions in `connector.py` each process this same list and apply a different pattern.

Source shape returned by `get_users()`:
```json
{
  "user_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": [
    {"order_id": "ORD-1", "amount": 20.5},
    {"order_id": "ORD-2", "amount": 35.0}
  ]
}
```

### Flatten into columns

When the source returns a single nested object alongside top-level fields, each field in the nested object can be promoted to a top-level column on the parent table. 
Destination — `users_flattened` (composite PK: `user_id` + `order_id`):

| user_id | name  | order_id | amount |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1       | Alice | ORD-1    | 20.5   |
| 1       | Alice | ORD-2    | 35.0   |

Refer to `sync_flattened()`.

### Break out into child tables

The nested orders list is split into a parent table and a child table. All non-nested fields are written to the parent `users` table. Each order becomes its own row in the child `orders` table.

Order IDs in this example are sequential per user (`ORD-1`, `ORD-2` ...) and are not globally unique. A composite primary key (`user_id`, `order_id`) is therefore required to uniquely identify each order row.

Destination — `users` (parent):

| user_id | name  |
|---------|-------|
| 1       | Alice |

Destination — `orders` (child, composite PK: `user_id` + `order_id`):

| user_id | order_id | amount |
|---------|----------|--------|
| 1       | ORD-1    | 20.5   |
| 1       | ORD-2    | 35.0   |

Refer to `sync_parent_child()`.

### Write as a JSON blob

The nested `orders` list is stored as a single JSON blob in the `data` column. This avoids frequent schema changes and preserves the full structure for downstream consumers. The Connector SDK accepts the Python dictionary directly; no manual serialization is required.

Destination — `users_data`:

| user_id | name  | data                        |
|---------|-------|-----------------------------|
| 1       | Alice | {"orders": [...]}           |

Refer to `sync_json_blob()`.


## Error handling

- Checkpointing – the connector checkpoints state after every table sync completes and at every `__CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` upserts within a table. If a sync is interrupted, Fivetran resumes from the last checkpoint rather than replaying the entire sync from the beginning.


## Tables created

This connector creates four destination tables across the three data handling patterns.

`users_flattened` — pattern 1, flatten into columns (composite PK: `user_id` + `order_id`):

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| user_id (PK) | STRING | User identifier; part of composite PK |
| order_id (PK) | STRING | Sequential order identifier per user (ORD-1, ORD-2 ...); part of composite PK |
| name | STRING | User's full name, repeated on every order row |
| amount | DOUBLE | Order total amount |

`users` — pattern 2, parent table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| user_id (PK) | STRING | Unique user identifier |
| name | STRING | User's full name |

`orders` — pattern 2, child table (composite PK):

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| user_id (PK) | STRING | Foreign key referencing `users.user_id`; part of composite PK |
| order_id (PK) | STRING | Sequential order identifier per user (ORD-1, ORD-2 ...); part of composite PK |
| amount | DOUBLE | Order total amount |

`users_data` — pattern 3, JSON blob:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| user_id (PK) | STRING | Unique user identifier |
| name | STRING | User's full name |
| data | JSON | Nested orders stored as a JSON blob |


## Additional files

- `mock_api.py` – A simulated API that returns a list of user records with randomized values and a fixed schema, each containing a nested orders list used by the connector.
