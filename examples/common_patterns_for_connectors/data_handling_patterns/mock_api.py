"""
This module simulates a single external API call that returns users with multiple nested
data structures.:

Pattern 1 — address + orders → flatten everything into a single flat table (one row per order, parent fields repeated)
Pattern 2 — orders (nested list)  → break into parent/child tables
Pattern 3 — address + orders      → write as JSON blob

In a real-world connector, replace get_users() with your actual API call or database
query logic. Add pagination, retry handling, and rate-limit backoff as needed.

    Simulate a single API call that returns users, each containing a nested address object
    and a nested orders list. All three data handling patterns in connector.py are applied
    to this single response.

    The schema (field names and structure) is fixed. Only the values are randomized using
    Faker to simulate realistic variability across syncs.

    In a real-world connector, replace this with your actual API call or database query.
    Add pagination if your source returns results across multiple pages.
    Add retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient API errors.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, each representing a user with a nested address object
        and a nested orders list.
