# Environment-Driven Connectivity Connector Example


## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to build a connector that automatically selects API endpoints based on the deployment environment. It uses the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to showcase environment-driven connectivity patterns, switching between a production mirror and the direct API endpoint using the `FIVETRAN_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL` environment variable.

- **Production environment**: Uses a mirror (https://swapi.py4e.com/api) for improved reliability and performance
- **Local debug environment**: Uses the direct API endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api) for development and testing


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Environment-aware endpoint selection: Automatically switches between production and debug API endpoints
- Comprehensive data coverage: Syncs all six SWAPI resource types (people, planets, films, species, starships, vehicles)
- Robust pagination handling: Efficiently processes paginated API responses
- Retry logic with exponential backoff: Handles transient failures with configurable retry attempts
- Rate limiting support: Respects HTTP 429 responses and Retry-After headers


## Configuration file
This connector does not require any configuration parameters in `configuration.json` as it uses a public API. You can add configuration parameters if needed for your specific use case.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This example does not require any additional Python packages beyond those pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. Therefore, no `requirements.txt` file is needed.


Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not require authentication as it uses SWAPI. The API is freely accessible without API keys or credentials.

The Fivetran platform automatically sets the `FIVETRAN_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL` environment variable based on the deployment context. See the [Working with Connector SDK documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/working-with-connector-sdk#referencingenvironmentvariablesinyourcode) for details.

## Pagination
The connector handles pagination automatically using SWAPI's pagination structure:

- Makes an initial request to the resource endpoint (e.g., `/people/`)
- Extracts the results array from the response
- Yields each page of results to the caller for processing
- Follows the next URL from the response to fetch the next page
- Continues until the next field is null, indicating the end of data

Each page is processed immediately before fetching the next page, ensuring memory-efficient streaming of large datasets.


## Data handling
The connector processes data as follows:

- Resource discovery: Fetches all available resource types from the SWAPI root endpoint
- Streaming pagination: Processes each page of results immediately without loading all data into memory
- Data validation: Skips records without a required url field and logs warnings
- Upsert operations: Uses the url field as the primary key for inserting or updating records.


## Error handling
The connector implements comprehensive error handling:

- Retry logic: Attempts up to three retries for transient failures
- Exponential backoff: Doubles wait time between retries (1s, 2s, 4s), capped at 16 seconds
- Rate limiting: Handles HTTP 429 responses by respecting the Retry-After header
- Request timeout: 20-second timeout for all API requests to prevent hanging
- Exception logging: Logs warnings for each retry attempt and severe errors when all retries are exhausted
- Graceful degradation: Skips invalid records (missing url field) with warnings rather than failing the entire sync


## Tables created

The connector creates six tables in your destination:

### PEOPLE
- Primary key: url
- Columns: All fields from SWAPI's people resource, including:
  - created, edited (`UTC_DATETIME`)
  - films, species, starships, vehicles (`JSON` arrays)

### PLANETS
- Primary key: url
- Columns: All fields from SWAPI's planets resource, including:
  - created, edited (`UTC_DATETIME`)
  - residents, films (`JSON` arrays)

### FILMS
- Primary key: url
- Columns: All fields from SWAPI's films resource, including:
  - created, edited (`UTC_DATETIME`)
  - release_date (`NAIVE_DATE`)
  - characters, planets, starships, vehicles, species (`JSON` arrays)

### SPECIES
- Primary key: url
- Columns: All fields from SWAPI's species resource, including:
  - created, edited (`UTC_DATETIME`)
  - people, films (`JSON` arrays)

### STARSHIPS
- Primary key: url
- Columns: All fields from SWAPI's starships resource, including:
  - created, edited (`UTC_DATETIME`)
  - pilots, films (`JSON` arrays)

### VEHICLES
- Primary key: url
- Columns: All fields from SWAPI's vehicles resource, including:
  - created, edited (`UTC_DATETIME`)
  - pilots, films (`JSON` arrays)
