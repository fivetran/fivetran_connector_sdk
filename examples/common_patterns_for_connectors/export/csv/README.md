# CSV Export API Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to build a Fivetran connector that consumes data from a REST API that returns CSV content (commonly used in export/reporting APIs). It fetches the CSV payload from a given URL, parses the content, and upserts each row into a table named `USER`.

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates handling of CSV responses from a REST API.
- Uses `csv.DictReader` to parse CSV into a list of dictionaries.
- Upserts rows into a single `USER` table.
- Logs data parsing steps and sync status.
- Includes `checkpoint()` for state persistence (though no incremental cursor is implemented).


## Configuration file
This example does not require any user-supplied configuration.

In a real-life implementation, you might include API keys, date ranges, or export task parameters in `configuration.json`.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This example uses a local development server without authentication.
In production scenarios, you may need to:
- Add headers for API key or Bearer token
- Sign requests with OAuth or session tokens

Modify `get_csv_response()` to add the appropriate headers based on your API’s requirements.


## Pagination
This connector does not support pagination.
To support multipage or batched CSV exports in the future, consider:
- Fetching files from a paginated endpoint.
- Streaming partial CSV responses.
- Polling export tasks and downloading files.


## Data handling
- The connector sends an HTTP GET request to the CSV endpoint.
- The raw text response is parsed using Python’s built-in csv module.
- Each CSV row is converted to a dictionary and upserted into the user table.
- State is checkpointed after the batch for safe resumption on subsequent runs.


## Error handling
- HTTP errors are raised using `raise_for_status()`.
- Parsing errors during CSV transformation are handled implicitly via Python’s `csv.DictReader`.
- `log.info()` is used for tracking sync steps and row-level operations.


## Tables created
The connector creates the `USER` table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
