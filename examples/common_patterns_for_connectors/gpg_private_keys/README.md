# GPG-Signed Message Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to use [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) via the `python-gnupg` library to sign data using a private GPG key. The connector takes a static message, signs it using a GPG private key provided in the configuration, verifies the signature, and upserts the signed message into a destination table named `SIGNED_MESSAGE`.

This example is ideal for learning how to:
- Import and manage PGP/GPG private keys within a connector.
- Sign and verify data using `gnupg`.
- Integrate cryptographic signing logic with the Fivetran Connector SDK.

This connector is built for educational purposes and uses hardcoded test data. It is not production-ready without further security hardening.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## GPG key pair setup
To use this example, you must generate a GPG key pair and copy the private key (ASCII-armored) into your `configuration.json`.

## Features
- Signs a message using a GPG private key
- Verifies the signature validity before syncing
- Uses `python-gnupg` for GPG operations
- Demonstrates use of `op.upsert()` to deliver signed data to a destination table


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "private_key": "<YOUR_ESCAPED_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY>",
  "passphrase": "<YOUR_PASSPHRASE>"
}
```

`private_key`: Your GPG private key, formatted as a single-line escaped JSON string (ASCII-armored).
To export your private key in this format, you can use:
```bash
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <YOUR_KEY_ID>
```
Then properly escape newline characters (e.g., \n) for JSON compatibility.

`passphrase`: The GPG passphrase used to unlock your private key for signing.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
python-gnupg
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not use API-based authentication, but relies on cryptographic signing via a user-provided GPG  private key and passphrase.
- The private key is imported dynamically at runtime using `gpg.import_keys()`.
- Signing is performed using `gpg.sign()`.
- Signature verification is done with `gpg.verify()`.

If either the key import or the signature validation fails, the connector raises an error and aborts the sync.


## Pagination
This connector does not interact with paginated data sources. It signs a static test message.


## Data handling
- Validates configuration to ensure `private_key` and `passphrase` are present.
- Imports the private key into a `gnupg.GPG()` object.
- Signs a fixed plaintext message.
- Verifies the signature is valid.
- Upserts the signed message into the `signed_message` table.
- Saves sync state using `op.checkpoint()`.


## Error handling
- If `private_key` or `passphrase` is missing, a `ValueError` is raised.
- If the GPG key import fails, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
- If the signature cannot be verified, the sync is aborted with an exception.
- All actions are logged using the SDKâ€™s `Logging` module.


## Tables created
The connector creates the `SIGNED_MESSAGE` table:

```
{
  "table": "signed_message",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "message": "STRING"
  }
}
```
