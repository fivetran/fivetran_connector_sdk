# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# It defines a simple `update` method, which uses python-gnupg to sign messages with a private key.
# This example upserts the signed data to a table named "signed_message".
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details

# Note on GPG Key Generation:
# To use this example, you'll need a GPG key pair. To generate your own GPG key pair, you can follow these guides:
# - GnuPG official documentation: https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html
# https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key
# https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/creating-gpg-keypairs

# Import required classes from fivetran_connector_sdk
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector # For supporting Connector operations like Update() and Schema()
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Logging as log # For enabling Logs in your connector code
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Operations as op # For supporting Data operations like Upsert(), Update(), Delete() and checkpoint()

# This method is used to import the private key into the GPG object.
# The private key is used to sign messages.
# The method takes the configuration dictionary and the GPG object as parameters.

# This is a simple example that imports only one key.

# This method is used to sign a message using the GPG object.
# The method takes the configuration dictionary, the GPG object, the key, and the message to be signed as parameters.

# The passphrase should correspond to the private key used for signing.

# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#schema
# The schema function takes one parameter:
# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.

            } # For any columns whose names are not provided here, e.g. message, their data types will be inferred
        }

# Define the update function, which is a required function, and is called by Fivetran during each sync.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:
# - configuration: dictionary contains any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector
# - state: a dictionary contains whatever state you have chosen to checkpoint during the prior sync
# The state dictionary is empty for the first sync or for any full re-sync

    # Initialize the GPG object
    # You can pass the gnupghome parameter to the GPG object if you want to use a different directory for GPG keys.
    # for example, gnupg.GPG(gnupghome="/path/to/your/custom/gnupg/home")
    # When specifying a custom gnupghome parameter:
    # 1. The directory must exist and have proper permissions (typically 700)
    # 2. GPG needs specific files and directory structure to function properly
    # 3. Custom directories must be initialized before use with proper ownership
    # If the directory is not initialized properly, GPG will throw an error.
    # When not specifying gnupghome, it defaults to ~/.gnupg which is already properly configured in the production environment.
    gpg = gnupg.GPG()
    # Load the private key from the configuration and import it into the GPG object
    key = get_gpg_key(configuration, gpg)

    # This is the message to be signed
    # You can change this to any message you want to sign

    # The yield statement returns a generator object.
    # This generator will yield an upsert operation to the Fivetran connector.
    # The op.upsert method is called with two arguments:
    # - The first argument is the name of the table to upsert the data into, in this case, "signed_message".
    # - The second argument is a dictionary containing the data to be upserted,
