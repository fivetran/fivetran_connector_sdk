# Incremental Sync Strategies Examples

This directory contains individual examples demonstrating different incremental sync strategies using the Fivetran Connector SDK. Each strategy is implemented as a separate, focused example with its own configuration and documentation.

## Available strategies

### 1. [Keyset Pagination](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/keyset_pagination/)
**Best for**: APIs with cursor-based pagination support
- Uses a cursor (e.g., `updatedAt` timestamp) to fetch new/updated records
- Saves the last `updatedAt` value as state
- Handles scroll parameters for pagination continuation
- **Most efficient** for truly incremental syncs

### 2. [Offset Pagination](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/offset_pagination/)
**Best for**: APIs with offset pagination and timestamp filtering support
- Uses timestamp filtering with offset pagination to fetch records in batches
- Saves the latest processed timestamp as state
- Combines incremental sync with pagination for large datasets
- **Efficient incremental sync** with pagination support

### 3. [Timestamp Sync](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/timestamp_sync/)
**Best for**: APIs with timestamp-based filtering
- Uses a timestamp to fetch records updated since the last sync
- Saves the latest processed timestamp as state
- **Truly incremental** - only processes changed records
- **Most efficient** for APIs that support timestamp filtering

### 4. [Step-size Sync](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/step_size_sync/)
**Best for**: APIs without traditional pagination support
- Uses ID ranges to fetch records in batches
- Saves the current ID position as state
- Works with any API that supports ID-based filtering
- **Universal compatibility** but not truly incremental

### 5. [Replay Sync](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/replay_sync/)
**Best for**: Read-replica scenarios with replication lag
- Uses timestamp-based sync with a configurable buffer
- Goes back X hours from the last timestamp to handle delays
- **Most robust** for distributed systems
- **Data consistency** focused

## Quick comparison

| Strategy | Incremental | Efficiency | Complexity | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Keyset Pagination | ✅ Yes | High | Medium | APIs with cursor support |
| Offset Pagination | ✅ Yes | High | Medium | APIs with offset + timestamp filtering |
| Timestamp Sync | ✅ Yes | High | Low | APIs with timestamp filtering |
| Step-size Sync | ❌ No | Medium | Low | APIs without pagination |
| Replay Sync | ✅ Yes | Medium | Medium | Read-replica systems |

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Workflow

1. **Choose your strategy** based on your API capabilities and requirements
2. **Navigate to the strategy folder** (e.g., `keyset_pagination/`)
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install fivetran-connector-sdk
   ```
4. **Configure your API endpoint** by modifying the private global variables in `connector.py`
5. **Run the connector** for local testing:
   ```
   fivetran debug
   ```

## Tables created

All strategies sync data to the same `USER` table with this schema:

```json
{
   "table": "user",
   "primary_key": ["id"],
   "columns": {
      "id": "STRING",
      "name": "STRING",
      "email": "STRING",
      "address": "STRING",
      "company": "STRING",
      "job": "STRING",
      "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
      "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
   }
}
```

## Choosing the right strategy

### For APIs with cursor-based pagination:
- **Use**: Keyset Pagination
- **Why**: Most efficient for incremental syncs

### For APIs with offset pagination and timestamp filtering:
- **Use**: Offset Pagination
- **Why**: Combines incremental sync with pagination for large datasets

### For APIs with timestamp filtering:
- **Use**: Timestamp Sync
- **Why**: Truly incremental and efficient

### For APIs without pagination support:
- **Use**: Step-size Sync
- **Why**: Works with ID-based filtering

### For read-replica systems:
- **Use**: Replay Sync
- **Why**: Handles replication lag
