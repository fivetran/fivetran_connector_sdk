# Keyset Pagination Incremental Sync Strategy Connector Example

**Complete Example Link:** [examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/keyset_pagination/](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/keyset_pagination/)

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates **keyset pagination** for incremental syncs using the Fivetran Connector SDK. Keyset pagination uses a cursor (typically an `updatedAt` timestamp) to fetch new and updated records since the last sync.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- **Cursor-based**: Uses a cursor value (like `updatedAt` timestamp) to track the last processed record
- **State Management**: Saves the last `updatedAt` value in the connector state
- **Incremental Fetching**: Only fetches records where `updatedAt` is greater than the saved cursor
- **Scroll Support**: Handles APIs that use scroll parameters for pagination
- **Efficient**: Only processes new/updated records
- **Reliable**: Handles large datasets without missing records
- **Scalable**: Works well with APIs that support cursor-based pagination

## Requirements file

* The connector requires no packages

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`.

## API requirements

Your API should support:
- `updated_since` parameter to filter records by timestamp
- Optional `scroll_param` for pagination continuation
- Records with an `updatedAt` field for cursor tracking

## State management

The connector saves state as:
```json
{
  "last_updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Data handling

The connector processes data as follows:
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches records using cursor-based pagination
- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes records updated since the last sync
- **State Tracking**: Updates the cursor after processing each batch

## Tables created

The connector syncs data to the `USER` table with the following schema:

```json
{
   "table": "user",
   "primary_key": ["id"],
   "columns": {
      "id": "STRING",
      "name": "STRING",
      "email": "STRING",
      "address": "STRING",
      "company": "STRING",
      "job": "STRING",
      "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
      "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
   }
}
```

## When to use keyset pagination

- APIs that support cursor-based pagination
- When you need to track record updates by timestamp
- Large datasets where you want to avoid reprocessing unchanged records
- APIs that provide scroll parameters for pagination continuation

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling:
- **API Response Validation**: Checks for successful HTTP responses
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data contains required fields
- **State Management**: Safely updates and checkpoints state
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides informative log messages for troubleshooting

## Additional considerations

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the fivetran-api-playground package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.
