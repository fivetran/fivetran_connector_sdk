# Offset-based Pagination Incremental Sync Strategy Connector Example

**Complete Example Link:** [examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/offset_pagination/](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/offset_pagination/)

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates **offset-based pagination** for incremental syncs using the Fivetran Connector SDK. This strategy uses timestamp-based filtering with offset pagination to fetch records in batches, saving the latest timestamp as state for the next sync.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- **Timestamp Filtering**: Uses `updated_since` parameter to filter records by timestamp
- **Offset Tracking**: Uses offset from API response to track pagination progress
- **State Management**: Saves the latest processed timestamp in connector state
- **Batch Processing**: Processes records in configurable page sizes
- **Incremental**: Only processes records updated since the last sync
- **Efficient**: Uses timestamp filtering to avoid reprocessing unchanged records
- **Reliable**: Handles large datasets with proper pagination

## Requirements file

* The connector requires no packages

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`.

## API requirements

Your API should support:
- `updated_since` parameter to filter records by timestamp
- `order_by` and `order_type` parameters for consistent ordering
- `limit` parameter to specify the number of records per page
- Response should include `offset`, `limit`, and `total` fields
- Records with an `updatedAt` field for timestamp tracking

## API response format

The API should return responses in this format:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": "1", "name": "John Doe", "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z", ...},
    {"id": "2", "name": "Jane Smith", "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z", ...}
  ],
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 100,
  "total": 500
}
```

## State management

The connector saves state as:
```json
{
  "last_updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Data handling

The connector processes data as follows:
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches records using offset-based pagination with timestamp filtering
- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes records updated since the last sync
- **Batch Processing**: Processes records in configurable page sizes
- **State Tracking**: Updates the timestamp after processing each batch


## Tables created

The connector syncs data to the `USER` table with the following schema:

```json
{
   "table": "user",
   "primary_key": ["id"],
   "columns": {
      "id": "STRING",
      "name": "STRING",
      "email": "STRING",
      "address": "STRING",
      "company": "STRING",
      "job": "STRING",
      "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
      "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
   }
}
```

## When to use offset pagination

- APIs that support both timestamp filtering and offset pagination
- When you need truly incremental syncs with pagination
- Large datasets where you want to avoid reprocessing unchanged records
- APIs that return offset information in responses

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling:
- **API Response Validation**: Checks for successful HTTP responses
- **Pagination Validation**: Ensures proper offset and total field handling
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data contains required fields
- **State Management**: Safely updates and checkpoints state
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides informative log messages for troubleshooting

## Important considerations

- **API Compatibility**: Requires specific API response format with offset/total fields
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Requires accurate and consistent `updatedAt` timestamps
- **Ordering**: API must support consistent ordering by timestamp
- **Performance**: More efficient than simple offset pagination for incremental syncs

## Additional considerations

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the fivetran-api-playground package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.
