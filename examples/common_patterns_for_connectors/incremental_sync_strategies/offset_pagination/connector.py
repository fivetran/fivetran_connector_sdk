"""This connector demonstrates offset-based pagination for incremental syncs using the Fivetran Connector SDK.
It uses an offset and page size to fetch records in batches, saving the offset as state.
This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the fivetran-api-playground package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details
