# Replay Incremental Sync Strategy Connector Example

**Complete Example Link:** [examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/replay_sync/](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/replay_sync/)

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates **replay incremental sync with buffer** using the Fivetran Connector SDK. This strategy uses timestamp-based sync with a configurable buffer (goes back X hours from the last timestamp) to handle read-replica scenarios with replication lag.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- **Buffer-based Filtering**: Applies a time buffer to the last processed timestamp
- **Replication Lag Handling**: Accounts for delays in read-replica systems
- **State Management**: Saves the latest processed timestamp in connector state
- **Overlap Processing**: Re-processes some records to ensure no data is missed
- **Replication Lag Safe**: Handles delays in read-replica systems
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures no records are missed due to timing issues
- **Configurable Buffer**: Adjustable buffer time for different replication scenarios
- **Reliable**: Robust against timing-related data inconsistencies

## Requirements file

* The connector requires no packages

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`.

## API requirements

Your API should support:
- `since` parameter to filter records by timestamp
- Records with an `updatedAt` field for timestamp tracking
- Consistent timestamp format (ISO 8601 recommended)
- Ability to return all records updated since a given timestamp

## State management

The connector saves state as:
```json
{
  "last_timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Data handling

The connector processes data as follows:
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches records using timestamp-based filtering with buffer
- **Buffer Application**: Applies time buffer to handle replication lag
- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes records updated since the buffered timestamp
- **State Tracking**: Updates the timestamp after processing all records


## Tables created

The connector syncs data to the `USER` table with the following schema:

```json
{
   "table": "user",
   "primary_key": ["id"],
   "columns": {
      "id": "STRING",
      "name": "STRING",
      "email": "STRING",
      "address": "STRING",
      "company": "STRING",
      "job": "STRING",
      "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
      "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
   }
}
```

## When to use replay sync

- **Read-replica scenarios**: When reading from a replica with potential replication lag
- **High-availability systems**: Where data consistency is critical
- **Distributed databases**: With eventual consistency models
- **APIs with timing delays**: Where updates may not be immediately available
- **Critical data scenarios**: Where missing records is not acceptable

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling:
- **API Response Validation**: Checks for successful HTTP responses
- **Timestamp Validation**: Ensures proper timestamp format and buffer calculation
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data contains required fields
- **State Management**: Safely updates and checkpoints state
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides informative log messages for troubleshooting

## Buffer configuration

The `buffer_hours` parameter determines how far back to look from the last timestamp:

- **Small buffer (1-2 hours)**: For systems with minimal replication lag
- **Medium buffer (2-6 hours)**: For typical read-replica scenarios
- **Large buffer (6+ hours)**: For systems with significant replication delays

## Important considerations

- **Overlap Processing**: This strategy may re-process some records due to the buffer
- **Performance Impact**: Larger buffers mean more data processing
- **Duplicate Handling**: The connector uses upsert to handle potential duplicates
- **Buffer Sizing**: Choose buffer size based on your replication lag characteristics

## Example buffer calculation

If your last timestamp was `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` and buffer_hours is 2:
- Buffer timestamp: `2024-01-15T08:30:00Z`
- The connector will fetch all records updated since 8:30 AM instead of 10:30 AM
- This ensures any records that were delayed in replication are captured

## Additional considerations

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the fivetran-api-playground package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.
