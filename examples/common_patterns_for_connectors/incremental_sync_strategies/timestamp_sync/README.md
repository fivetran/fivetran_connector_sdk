# Timestamp-based Incremental Sync Strategy Connector Example

**Complete Example Link:** [examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/timestamp_sync/](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/incremental_sync_strategies/timestamp_sync/)

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates **timestamp-based incremental sync** using the Fivetran Connector SDK. This strategy uses a timestamp to fetch all records updated since the last sync, saving the latest timestamp as state for the next sync.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- **Time-based Filtering**: Uses a timestamp to filter records updated since the last sync
- **State Management**: Saves the latest processed timestamp in connector state
- **Incremental Processing**: Only fetches records with `updatedAt` greater than the saved timestamp
- **Efficient Updates**: Processes only new and modified records
- **Truly Incremental**: Only processes records that have changed since the last sync
- **Efficient**: Minimizes API calls and data processing
- **Reliable**: Handles large datasets without performance degradation
- **Simple**: Easy to implement and maintain

## Requirements file

* The connector requires no packages

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`.

## API requirements

Your API should support:
- `since` parameter to filter records by timestamp
- Records with an `updatedAt` field for timestamp tracking
- Consistent timestamp format (ISO 8601 recommended)
- Ability to return all records updated since a given timestamp

## State management

The connector saves state as:
```json
{
  "last_timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Data handling

The connector processes data as follows:
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches records using timestamp-based filtering
- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes records updated since the last sync
- **State Tracking**: Updates the timestamp after processing all records


## Tables created

The connector syncs data to the `USER` table with the following schema:

```json
{
   "table": "user",
   "primary_key": ["id"],
   "columns": {
      "id": "STRING",
      "name": "STRING",
      "email": "STRING",
      "address": "STRING",
      "company": "STRING",
      "job": "STRING",
      "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
      "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
   }
}
```

## When to use timestamp-based sync

- APIs that support timestamp-based filtering
- When you need truly incremental syncs
- Large datasets where efficiency is important
- When records have reliable `updatedAt` timestamps
- APIs that can return all changes since a given timestamp

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling:
- **API Response Validation**: Checks for successful HTTP responses
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data contains required fields
- **State Management**: Safely updates and checkpoints state
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides informative log messages for troubleshooting

## Important considerations

- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Requires accurate and consistent `updatedAt` timestamps
- **Time Zones**: Ensure consistent timezone handling
- **API Limitations**: Some APIs may have limits on how far back you can query
- **Data Consistency**: Assumes records are updated with current timestamps

## Additional considerations

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the fivetran-api-playground package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.
