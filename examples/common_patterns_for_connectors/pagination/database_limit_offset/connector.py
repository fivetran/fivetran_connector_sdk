    The sync_items function handles the retrieval and processing of paginated database rows using LIMIT/OFFSET.
    It performs the following tasks:
        1. Queries the database for a page of rows starting at the current offset.
        2. Processes the returned rows using upsert operations to send to Fivetran.
        3. Advances the offset by the number of rows returned after each page.
        4. Saves the offset in state after each page so the sync can resume if interrupted.
        5. Continues until no more rows are returned.

    LIMIT/OFFSET pagination adds LIMIT <N> OFFSET <k> to every query. It is simple to implement
    but has two important limitations:
        1. Row-shift: if rows are inserted or deleted while paging, later offsets can shift,
           causing gaps or duplicate rows. Mitigate this with a deterministic ORDER BY.
        2. Performance: the database must scan and skip OFFSET rows for every page, so queries
           become slower as the offset grows. For large or frequently updated tables, prefer
           keyset pagination (see the database_keyset example).

    Query pattern:
        SELECT id, name, email, updated_at FROM {table}
