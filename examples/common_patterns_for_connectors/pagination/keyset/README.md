# Key-Based Pagination Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to implement keyset pagination for syncing data from a REST API that supports incremental fetching using a cursor or scroll token. The connector retrieves user records from a mock API that returns a `scroll_param` in its response, which is used to fetch subsequent pages of results.

This is a common pattern for APIs that do not support offset-based pagination, but instead provide a token (e.g. `updated_since`, `next_cursor`, `scroll_param`) to retrieve the next chunk of data.

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates cursor-based (keyset) pagination.
- Fetches pages of data using a `scroll_param` token returned by the API.
- Tracks sync progress using a timestamp `updatedAt` checkpoint.
- Implements `op.checkpoint()` for resumable and incremental syncs.
- Parses and upserts all paginated results into a `USER` table.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a configuration file.

For production connectors, `configuration.json` might contain API tokens, initial cursors, or filters to narrow down API results.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not use authentication.

In real-world scenarios, modify `get_api_response()` to add `Authorization` headers or include API keys in query parameters.


## Pagination
Pagination is handled using a scroll key (cursor) from the response:
- On the first sync, the connector starts with updated_since = '0001-01-01T00:00:00Z'
- Each API response includes:
  - A list of data items 
  - A `scroll_param` token used to fetch the next page
- The connector continues fetching data until no `scroll_param` is returned


## Data handling
- Fetches and processes paginated records from a REST endpoint.
- Extracts and updates `state["last_updated_at"]` after each record.
- Syncs each item to Fivetran using `op.upsert(table="user", data=...)`.
- Periodically checkpoints state to support reliable resume.


## Error handling
- API errors raise exceptions via `raise_for_status()`.
- Empty pages halt pagination gracefully.
- Invalid responses (missing scroll keys or data) are handled implicitly.

## Tables created
The connector creates the `USER` table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
