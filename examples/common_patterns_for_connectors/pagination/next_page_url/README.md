# Next Page URL Pagination Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to implement next-page URL-based pagination for REST APIs. The connector fetches records from a paginated API where the next page of results is retrieved via a `next_page_url` included in the API response. It syncs user data into a destination table named `USER`.

This pagination strategy is useful when:
- The API includes the full URL for the next page in each response
- Query parameters may vary or include tokens that must be preserved across page

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates handling of `next_page_url` pagination logic.
- Tracks sync position using the `updatedAt` timestamp.
- Automatically follows next-page links across paginated API responses.
- Uses `op.checkpoint()` to safely store progress across runs.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a configuration file.

For production connectors, `configuration.json `might contain API tokens, initial cursors, or filters to narrow down API results.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not use authentication.

In real-world scenarios, modify `get_api_response()` to add `Authorization` headers or include API keys in query parameters.


## Pagination
Pagination is based on the next_page_url key provided in the API response:
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "next_page_url": "https://api.example.com/page=2"
}
```
- The initial request includes `updated_since`, `order_by`, and `per_page`.
- If `next_page_url` is present, it is used as the next request's endpoint.
- Query parameters are cleared because theyâ€™re already embedded in the `next_page_url`.

Pagination continues until no `next_page_url` is returned.


## Data handling
- The connector fetches user records from each page.
- Each row is passed to `op.upsert()` for syncing into the `USER` table.
- The `state["last_updated_at"]` field is updated after processing each row.
- `op.checkpoint()` is called to persist the cursor across runs.

## Error handling
- API errors are raised via `response.raise_for_status()`.
- If no data or `next_page_url` is present, pagination ends gracefully.
- All actions are logged with `log.info()` and `log.warning()`.

## Tables created
The connector creates the `USER` table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
