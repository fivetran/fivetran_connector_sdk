# Page Number-Based Pagination Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to implement page number-based pagination when syncing data from a REST API. It fetches paginated results using `page`, `per_page`, and `total_pages` values returned by the API and upserts them into a table named `USER`.

This is a common strategy used by REST APIs that support explicit control of pagination through numbered pages rather than offset, cursors, or next-page tokens.

This example is intended for learning purposes and uses the [fivetran-api-playground](https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/) package to mock the API responses locally. It is not meant for production use.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates page-by-page data retrieval from an API using `page` and `per_page`.
- Tracks sync progress with `updatedAt` as the replication cursor.
- Implements `op.checkpoint()` after each page to support resumability.
- Automatically ends pagination when all pages are processed.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a configuration file.

In production, configuration.json might contain API tokens, initial cursors, or filters to narrow down API results.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not use authentication.

In real-world scenarios, modify `get_api_response()` to add `Authorization` headers or include API keys in query parameters.


## Pagination
Pagination is handled via numeric page control:
- Query parameters:
  - `page`, `per_page`, `order_by`, `order_type` and `updated_since`.
- API response must contain:
  - `page`: current page number.
  - `total_pages`: total number of pages.


## Data handling
- Fetches users in ascending `updatedAt` order.
- Upserts each item into the user table via `op.upsert()`.
- Saves the updatedAt of the last item as a checkpoint after every page.
- Continues to the next page until all pages are exhausted.

## Error handling
- HTTP request errors are raised via `raise_for_status()`.
- Empty pages end pagination gracefully.
- Pagination stops when the current page matches total_pages.

## Tables Created
The connector creates one table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
