# Key-Based Pagination Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates the [Priority-First Sync (PFS)](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/features#priorityfirstsync) strategy, designed to sync recent data first while gradually backfilling historical records.
- Targets high-volume historical syncs where fresh data is prioritized for early availability.
- Alternates between:
  - Incremental Syncs: Pulls new or recently updated records.
  - Historical Syncs: Walks backward in time until a defined limit.
- Maintains separate cursors for incremental and historical progress per table.
- Currently supports the `USER` table as an example, using keyset pagination based on `updated_at`.

Ideal for connectors with large datasets where early access to recent records is critical.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Uses `Faker` to generate diverse test `USER` data.
- Syncs from a mock API with offset-based pagination.
- Demonstrates modular connector design using `users_sync.py`.
- Implements incremental sync logic using a timestamp field `updatedAt`.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a configuration file.

In production, a `configuration.json` might contain API tokens, initial cursors, or filters to narrow down API results.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
Faker==30.3.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector connects to a local mock server and does not require authentication. In a production scenario, use headers or token-based authentication in your request logic within `users_sync.py`.


## Pagination
- Pagination is handled within `users_sync.sync_users()` using a mock API response simulating `has_more` flags.
- For incremental syncs, data is paginated forward using the `updated_at` field, fetching records newer than the incremental cursor.
- For historical syncs, pagination proceeds backward in time, using a decreasing historical cursor until the historical limit is reached.
- Each response is processed in sequence, and `last_updated_at` is updated as the cursor.
- The `has_more` flag determines whether to continue paginating in the current batch.


## Data handling
- Uses two time-based cursors per endpoint:
  - `incremental_cursor` for recent data.
  - `historical_cursor` for older data.
- Sync alternates between incremental and historical runs to prioritize freshness while backfilling history.
- Data is pulled using the `updated_since` param and batched by time range (1-day chunks).
- Cursors are updated after each batch, ensuring resume-safe and idempotent syncs.
- Checkpointing is performed after every successful data load.


## Error handling
- Basic error handling is implemented via `response.raise_for_status()`.
- Invalid API responses or missing fields are skipped with log warnings.
- Sync will resume from the last checkpointed state if interrupted.


## Tables created
The connector creates a `USER` table:

```
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING",
    "address": "STRING",
    "company": "STRING",
    "job": "STRING",
    "updatedAt": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "createdAt": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```


## Additional files
The connector requires two additional files: 
- `mock_api.py` – A FastAPI-based server that simulates a REST API for serving `Faker`-generated user data.
- `users_sync.py` – A utility module that contains the `sync_users()` function, which handles all API requests, pagination logic, and sync state management.
