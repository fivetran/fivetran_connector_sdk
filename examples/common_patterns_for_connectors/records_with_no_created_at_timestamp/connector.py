# This example demonstrates how to handle records when the source does not provide a created_at (or equivalent) field.
# If you want to track when a record was first observed, the updated_at (or an equivalent, e.g., modified_at) field can
# be made part of the composite primary key. This ensures that successive syncs do not overwrite the updated_at field in
# the existing row in the destination. Instead, a new row is created with the new updated_at value.
# The record with the earliest value of the _fivetran_synced system column will indicate when the record was first
# observed in the source.

# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#schema
# The schema function takes one parameter:
# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.

                "id": "INT",

# Define the update function, which is a required function, and is called by Fivetran during each sync.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:
# - configuration: dictionary contains any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector
# - state: a dictionary contains whatever state you have chosen to checkpoint during the prior sync
# The state dictionary is empty for the first sync or for any full re-sync
