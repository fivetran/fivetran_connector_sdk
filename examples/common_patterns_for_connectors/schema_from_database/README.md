# Snowflake Schema-Aware Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to dynamically extract the schema from a Snowflake database and sync data from multiple tables using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It uses Snowflake’s information schema to identify column names, types, and primary keys, and generates a compatible schema for Fivetran. The connector then syncs data from the `PRODUCTS` and `ORDERS` tables using different replication strategies.

This example shows how to:
- Use Snowflake introspection for flexible schema definition.
- Sync one table in full-refresh mode (products).
- Sync another table incrementally based on a timestamp (orders).
- Convert Snowflake data types to Fivetran-compatible types.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Dynamically builds schema by querying Snowflake’s metadata.
- Supports column type mapping from Snowflake to Fivetran types.
- Automatically discovers primary keys using `SHOW PRIMARY KEYS`.
- Syncs `PRODUCTS` via full refresh.
- Syncs `ORDERS` incrementally using the `order_date` field.


## Configuration file
The following configuration keys are required:

```json
{
  "user":"<YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME>",
  "password":"<YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD>",
  "account":"<YOUR_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER>",
  "database":"<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>",
  "schema":"<YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME>",
  "tables": "<YOUR_TABLE_NAMES_SEPARATED_BY_COMMA>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:

```
snowflake_connector_python==3.14.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
The connector authenticates directly with Snowflake using the credentials from the configuration. It uses the native `snowflake.connector` Python library.


## Schema extraction
The connector queries Snowflake’s `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and `SHOW PRIMARY KEYS` to:
- Discover columns.
- Determine column types.
- Identify primary keys.
- Return a schema compatible with Fivetran SDK.

Unsupported or unknown data types default to `STRING`.


## Data handling
- The `PRODUCTS` table is loaded completely each time (full sync).
- The `ORDERS` table is synced incrementally using the `order_date` column:
  - It compares against state["lastOrder"].
  - Updates state after every row.


## Error handling
- Raises descriptive errors when configuration keys are missing.
- Uses `raise_for_status()` for failed SQL queries.
- Safely closes connections and cursors.

## Tables created
The connector creates the `PRODUCTS` and `ORDERS` tables:

`PRODUCTS`:
```json
{
  "table": "products",
  "primary_key": ["product_id"],
  "columns": {
    "product_id": "INT",
    "product_code": "STRING",
    "product_name": "STRING",
    "price": "DOUBLE",
    "in_stock": "BOOLEAN",
    "description": "STRING",
    "weight": "DOUBLE"
  }
}
```

`ORDERS`:
```json
{
  "table": "orders",
  "primary_key": ["order_id"],
  "columns": {
    "order_id": "STRING",
    "customer_id": "INT",
    "order_date": "NAIVE_DATE",
    "product_id": "INT",
    "quantity": "INT",
    "unit_price": "DOUBLE",
    "amount": "DOUBLE",
    "payment_method": "STRING",
    "status": "STRING",
    "street_address": "STRING",
    "city": "STRING",
    "state": "STRING",
    "zip": "STRING",
    "discount_applied": "DOUBLE"
  }
}
```
