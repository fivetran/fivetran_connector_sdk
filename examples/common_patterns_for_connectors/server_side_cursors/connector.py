    HOW IT WORKS
    - Executes `SELECT * FROM {table}`.
    - Uses a default (unnamed) cursor and repeatedly calls `fetchmany(batch_size)`.
    - This approach does not necessarily limit client memory use as the query is executed completely
    - Under some circumstances, the driver may buffer the entire result set client-side causing high memory use.
    PROS
    - Simple to implement and reason about.
    - Works everywhere without additional server-side state.
    CONS
    - The server may still prepare large result sets; network and memory use may be less optimal
      than a server-side (named) cursor for very large scans.
    - The client controls batching, but the portal is still client-side.
    BEST USE
    - Small-to-medium tables where simplicity is preferred.
    - Scenarios where server-side cursors are restricted, or you want minimal complexity.
    AVOID WHEN
    - Scanning very large tables where memory/round-trips are critical.
    - You need the server to strictly limit what's shipped per round-trip (prefer named cursor).

    HOW IT WORKS
    - Creates a named cursor (portal) on the server: rows remain on the server.
    - Sets `cursor.itersize = batch_size` to hint how many rows to fetch per network round-trip.
    - Repeatedly calls `fetchmany(batch_size)`; the server sends rows in small chunks.
    - Uses explicit transaction management to ensure the cursor remains valid throughout iteration.
    PROS
    - Much lower client memory footprint for huge result sets.
    - Better network efficiency via streaming from server.
    - Reduces risk of client OOM for large scans.
    CONS
    - Requires a persistent portal on the server during the transaction.
    - Some PaaS environments may impose limits on long-lived cursors.
    - Transaction remains open during the entire iteration.
    BEST USE
    - Large, sequential table scans.
    - Long-running reads where you want stable, predictable memory on the client.
    AVOID WHEN
    - The environment is hostile to long-lived transactions or portals.
    - You constantly need to interleave writes/commits mid-stream (sometimes `WITH HOLD` variants are needed).
