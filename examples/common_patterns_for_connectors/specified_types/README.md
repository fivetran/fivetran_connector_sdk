# All Supported Data Types Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector provides a minimal working example to demonstrate how to define all supported data types using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It uses the `schema()` method to declare columns of every core type, and the `update()` method to sync a single row containing example values for each type.

This is useful for:
- Testing downstream pipelines and integrations.
- Learning how to define and format each Fivetran-supported data type.
- Building a schema reference or validation utility.

For full type details, refer to the [Technical Reference â€“ Supported Data Types](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#supporteddatatypes).


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates every supported column data type, including:
  - `BOOLEAN`, `SHORT`, `LONG`, `DECIMAL`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`
  - `NAIVE_DATE`, `NAIVE_DATETIME`, `UTC_DATETIME`
  - `BINARY`, `XML`, `STRING`, `JSON`
- Shows how to define precision/scale for `DECIMAL`.
- Handles null values using `None` in Python.
- Includes a valid row with sample values for testing ingestion.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a `configuration.json` file.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
No external dependencies are required.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
No authentication is needed. This connector runs standalone for demonstration purposes.

## Pagination
Not applicable. This connector emits a single static row during each sync.


## Data handling
- The `schema()` function returns a full data-type definition for the specified table.
- The `update()` function constructs a dictionary containing values for each type.
- Binary and JSON fields are formatted using Python-native values.
- The connector make an `op.upsert()` call and checkpoints the state.


## Error handling
- Raises descriptive errors when configuration keys are missing.
- Uses `raise_for_status()` for failed SQL queries.
- Safely closes connections and cursors.

## Tables created
The connector creates one table:

```json
{
  "table": "specified",
  "primary_key": ["_bool"],
  "columns": {
    "_bool": "BOOLEAN",
    "_short": "SHORT",
    "_long": "LONG",
    "_dec": {
      "type": "DECIMAL",
      "precision": 15,
      "scale": 2
    },
    "_float": "FLOAT",
    "_double": "DOUBLE",
    "_ndate": "NAIVE_DATE",
    "_ndatetime": "NAIVE_DATETIME",
    "_utc": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "_binary": "BINARY",
    "_xml": "XML",
    "_str": "STRING",
    "_json": "JSON",
    "_null": "STRING"
  }
}
```
