# This example demonstrates how to connect to an API over SSH tunnels using `sshtunnel` and `paramiko`.
# This example uses key-based authentication for the SSH tunnel.
# It establishes a secure SSH tunnel from a local port to a remote API server port, allowing secure API access as if it were local.
# The connector uses an API key to authenticate and retrieve data from the API endpoint over the SSH tunnel.
# THIS EXAMPLE USES DUMMY DATA AND REQUIRES THE FIVETRAN-API-PLAYGROUND PACKAGE (https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/).
# For this example, an EC2 instance is running fivetran-api-playground and is only accessible via an SSH tunnel.
# See the Technical Reference documentation
# (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.
