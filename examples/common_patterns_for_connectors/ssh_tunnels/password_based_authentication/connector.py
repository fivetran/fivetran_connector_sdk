# This example demonstrates how to connect to an API over SSH tunnels using `sshtunnel`.
# This example uses password-based authentication for the SSH tunnel.
# It establishes a secure SSH tunnel from a local port to a remote API server port, allowing secure API access as if it were local.
# The connector uses an API key to authenticate and retrieve data from the API endpoint over the SSH tunnel.
# THIS EXAMPLE USES DUMMY DATA AND REQUIRES THE FIVETRAN-API-PLAYGROUND PACKAGE (https://pypi.org/project/fivetran-api-playground/).
# For this example, an EC2 instance is running fivetran-api-playground and is only accessible via an SSH tunnel.
# See the Technical Reference documentation
# (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.

# 1. Calls get_api_response to fetch data from the API using the provided parameters and authentication headers.
# 2. Extracts the list of items from the API response.
# 3. Yields an upsert operation for each item to insert/update it in the destination.
# 4. Yields a checkpoint operation to save the current sync state for resuming future syncs.
#
# The function takes three parameters:
# - params: A dictionary of query parameters to be sent with the API request.
# - state: A dictionary representing the current state of the sync, including the last retrieved key.
# - configuration: A dictionary contains any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector.

# The get_api_response function establishes an SSH tunnel to the remote server and sends an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint over the tunnel.
# It performs the following tasks:
# 1. Reads SSH connection details and password from the configuration. This uses password-based authentication.
# 2. Opens an SSH tunnel from a local port to the remote API server port using sshtunnel.
# 3. Logs the tunnel status for diagnostics.
# 4. Sends an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint through the tunnel, passing query parameters and authentication headers.
# 5. Raises an exception for any HTTP errors.
# 6. Parses and returns the JSON response from the API as a dictionary.
#
# Parameters:
# - params: A dictionary of query parameters to include in the API request.
# - headers: A dictionary of HTTP headers for authentication and content type.
# - configuration: A dictionary containing SSH and API connection details.
#
# Returns:
# - response_page: A dictionary containing the parsed JSON response from the API.
