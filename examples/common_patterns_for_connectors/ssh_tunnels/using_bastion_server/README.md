# SSH Tunnels Using Bastion Server Connector Example


## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to fetch and upsert data from a private PostgreSQL database server through an SSH tunnel via a bastion host. It establishes an SSH tunnel using `paramiko` and `sshtunnel` to a bastion host which then connects to the database with `psycopg2`, and incrementally syncs rows from `SAMPLE_USERS` based on a `modified_at` timestamp.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
The connector includes the following features:
- SSH tunnel to bastion host using `paramiko` and `sshtunnel`.
- Connects to PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2` running on private host via the bastion host.
- Incremental sync based on `modified_at` timestamp column.
- Error handling for SSH and database connection issues.
- Logging for debugging and monitoring.


## Configuration file
The connector reads the `configuration.json` to establish the SSH tunnel and DB connection.

- `bastion_host`: Public DNS/IP of the bastion.
- `bastion_port`: SSH port on bastion (default 22).
- `bastion_user`: SSH user for bastion.
- `bastion_private_key`: Base64‑encoded private key (PEM).
- `bastion_passphrase`: Optional passphrase for the private key.
- `db_host`: Private IP/DNS of PostgreSQL inside the network.
- `db_port`: PostgreSQL port.
- `db_user`: Database user.
- `db_password`: Database password.
- `db_name`: Database name.

```json
{
  "bastion_host": "<YOUR_BASTION_PUBLIC_IP_OR_DNS>",
  "bastion_port": "<YOUR_BASTION_SSH_PORT>",
  "bastion_user": "<YOUR_BASTION_USERNAME>",
  "bastion_private_key": "<YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_BASTION_PEM>",
  "bastion_passphrase": "<YOUR_BASTION_PASSPHRASE>",
  "private_host": "<YOUR_PRIVATE_DATABASE_HOST>",
  "private_port": "<YOUR_PRIVATE_DATABASE_PORT>",
  "db_user": "<YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME>",
  "db_password": "<YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD>",
  "db_name": "<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following packages, which should be listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
sshtunnel==0.4.0
paramiko==3.5.1
psycopg2-binary==2.9.10
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
- `Bastion host`: `SSH` key‑based authentication with an `RSA` private key. Provide the key as a base64‑encoded PEM string in `bastion_private_key`. If the key is passphrase‑protected, set `bastion_passphrase`.
- `Database`: Username and password for `PostgreSQL`.

You can get the base64‑encoded PEM string by running the following command on macOS or Linux:
```bash
base64 -i /path/to/your/pem/file | pbcopy
```


## Pagination
Pagination is not applicable for this connector as it retrieves data directly from a database table.


## Data handling
The connector fetches data from the `SAMPLE_USERS` table in the PostgreSQL database. It uses an incremental sync strategy based on the `modified_at` timestamp column to ensure that only new or updated records are replicated during each sync. The connector handles the data in following way:
- Establishes an SSH tunnel to the bastion host.
- Connects to the `PostgreSQL` database through the SSH tunnel.
- Executes a SQL query to fetch records from the `SAMPLE_USERS` table where the `modified_at` timestamp is greater than the last synced timestamp.
- Upserts the fetched records into the destination.
- Closes the database connection and SSH tunnel after the sync is complete.


## Error handling
The connector includes error handling mechanisms to manage potential issues during the SSH tunnel establishment, database connection, and data retrieval processes. Common errors handled include:
- SSH connection failures (e.g., incorrect credentials, network issues).
- Database connection errors (e.g., invalid database credentials, unreachable database).
- SQL execution errors (e.g., malformed queries, permission issues).
- Logging of error messages for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

## Tables created
The connector creates the following table in the destination:

- `SAMPLE_USERS`: Contains user data with fields such as `id`, `name`, and `modified_at`.

The schema of the `SAMPLE_USERS` table is as follows:
```json
{
  "id": "STRING",
  "name": "STRING",
  "modified_at": "UTC_DATETIME"
}
```
