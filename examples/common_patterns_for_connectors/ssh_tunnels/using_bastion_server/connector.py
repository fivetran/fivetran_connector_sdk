# This example demonstrates how to connect to a Database server over SSH tunnels via a Bastion Server using `sshtunnel` and `paramiko`.
# This example uses key-based authentication for the SSH tunnel.
# It establishes a secure SSH tunnel from a local port to a remote Bastion server port, which has access to a private database server .
# The connector uses Postgres credentials to fetch the data over the SSH tunnel.
# For this example, an EC2 instance is running PostgreSQL database server and is only accessible via a Bastion server over SSH.

# (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
