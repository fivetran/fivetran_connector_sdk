# Three Operations Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector illustrates how to perform all three core operations supported by the Fivetran Connector SDK:
- `op.upsert()` – Insert or update records.
- `op.update()` – Modify specific fields of an existing record.
- `op.delete()` – Delete records from the destination.

The connector generates synthetic data using Python’s `uuid` library and applies each of the operations on a test table named `THREE`. It is ideal for learning how the SDK interprets different change types and for validating downstream sync behavior.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates use of all supported Operations methods:
  - `op.upsert()` to insert new records.
  - `op.update()` to partially modify existing records.
  - `op.delete()` to remove records from the destination.
- Generates unique identifiers using `uuid.uuid4()`.
- Captures and logs operations via the `Logging` module.
- Uses checkpointing to persist sync progress.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a `configuration.json` file.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
No external dependencies are required.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
No authentication is needed. This connector runs standalone for demonstration purposes.

## Pagination
Not applicable. This connector emits a static test dataset in each run.


## Data handling
Each sync run performs the following:
- Upsert 3 rows
  - Three unique UUIDs are generated.
  - Rows are inserted into the `THREE` table with `id`, `val1`, and `val2`.
- Update one row
  - The second row `val1` is changed to `"abc"`.
- Delete one row
  - The third row is removed from the destination using `op.delete()`.
- Checkpoint
  - The sync concludes by checkpointing the current state.


## Tables created
The connector creates the `THREE` table:

```json
{
  "table": "three",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "val1": "STRING",
    "val2": "INT"
  }
}
```
