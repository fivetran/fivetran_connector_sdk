# This is an example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# This is an example of how to add endpoints or tables to sync to an existing Fivetran Connector SDK.
# The list of tables to sync can be retrieved from connector configs if they are not present in state object.
# The list of tables to sync is thereafter stored in the state object.
# This example is the simplest possible as it doesn't define a schema() function,
# it does not therefore provide a good template for writing a real connector.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details

# To observe how adding a new table would work:
# 1. Run fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json (configuration.json provides initialSyncStart)
# 2. Observe that files/state.json contains "synced_tables": ["A", "B", "C"]
# 3. In connector.py, add another table name to the list in TABLES_TO_SYNC, e.g. TABLES_TO_SYNC = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
# 4. Run fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json again
# 5. Log output should show "... FINE: D is new, needs history from ..."
# 6. Observe that files/state.json synced_tables now contains all tables in TABLES_TO_SYNC
# 7. Observe that the new table is synced for its full history for each iteration
