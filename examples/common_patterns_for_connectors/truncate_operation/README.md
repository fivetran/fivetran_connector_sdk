# Truncate Operation Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates the `truncate` operation in the Fivetran Connector SDK, showing how it interacts with `upsert()`, `update()`, and `delete()` on a single table.

`op.truncate()` soft-deletes all rows that exist in the destination at the point it is called by setting `_fivetran_deleted = true`. Rows emitted after `truncate()` within the same sync are not affected. This makes it useful for full-refresh patterns where the source replaces its entire dataset each sync.

The connector uses a hardcoded product catalog to walk through six stages. The resulting destination table state after each stage is shown as inline comments in `connector.py`.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```bash
fivetran init <project-path> --template examples/common_patterns_for_connectors/truncate_operation
```
`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`.
If you do not specify a project path, Fivetran creates the project in your current directory.
For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide#createyourcustomconnector).


## Features
- Shows destination table state after each operation as inline comments in `connector.py`.
- Uses hardcoded realistic data — no external APIs or configuration required.
- Covers key soft-delete behaviors: bulk truncate, post-truncate inserts, and row revival.


## Configuration file
No configuration file is required for this example.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
No external dependencies are required.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
No authentication is needed. This connector runs standalone for demonstration purposes.


## Pagination
Not applicable. This connector emits a static hardcoded dataset.


## Data handling
Each sync run walks through six stages on the `products` table:

- **Stage 1 — upsert:** Inserts 3 products; all active (`_fivetran_deleted = false`).
- **Stage 2 — update:** Patches Laptop price only; other columns unchanged.
- **Stage 3 — truncate:** All 3 existing rows soft-deleted (`_fivetran_deleted = true`).
- **Stage 4 — upsert after truncate:** Inserts 2 new products; not soft-deleted because they are emitted after `truncate()`.
- **Stage 5 — revive:** Upserting a previously truncated primary key sets `_fivetran_deleted = false` and applies new values.
- **Stage 6 — delete:** Soft-deletes Standing Desk by primary key using `op.delete()`.


## Key behaviors illustrated

**`truncate()` vs `delete()`**
- `op.truncate(table)` — soft-deletes every row in the table at the time of the call.
- `op.delete(table, keys)` — soft-deletes a single row identified by its primary key.

**Rows emitted after `truncate()` are not deleted**  
Any row upserted after `op.truncate()` in the same sync lands with `_fivetran_deleted = false`.

**Reviving a soft-deleted row**  
Upserting a row whose primary key was previously truncated or deleted sets `_fivetran_deleted = false` and applies the new column values.


## Tables created

The connector creates the `PRODUCTS` table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `product_id` | INT | Primary key |
| `name` | STRING | Product name |
| `category` | STRING | Product category |
| `price` | FLOAT | Product price |
| `in_stock` | BOOLEAN | Whether product is currently in stock |
