# Unspecified Column Types Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how the Fivetran Connector SDK automatically infers column names and data types from the data you send when the `schema()` method does not explicitly declare them. It’s a helpful example when:
- You want to quickly prototype a connector.
- The schema may vary over time or is dynamic.
- You want to see how Fivetran interprets Python-native types into SDK-compatible column definitions.

Each sync emits a single row containing a variety of types — strings, numbers, dates, JSON, binary, XML, and null values — into a table called `UNSPECIFIED`.

For more details on supported types and inference logic, refer to the [Technical Reference - Data Types](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#supporteddatatypes).


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Sends a variety of Python-native types without defining any columns in the schema.
- Demonstrates automatic type inference by Fivetran.
- Syncs a row using `op.upsert()` and checkpoints state for safe resumability.
- Uses null handling `None` to test how missing values are interpreted.


## Configuration file
This example does not require a configuration.json file.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
No external dependencies are required.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
No authentication is required.

## Pagination
Not applicable - this connector emits a single static row each sync.


## Data handling
- The `schema()` function defines only the table name and primary key (id).
- All column names and types are inferred from the keys and values in the data dictionary.
- Supported types are inferred from:
  - `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `dict`, `bytes`, `datetime` (in string form), and `None`.


## Tables created
The connector creates one table:

```json
{
  "table": "unspecified",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": "inferred"
}
```
