# Importing External Drivers using installation.sh script file.
import datetime

# This module implements a connector that requires external driver installation using installation.sh file
# It is an example of using default-libmysqlclient-dev and build-essential
# to communicate with MySql db and iterate over the data to update the connector

# NOTE: libpq5 and libpq-dev are pre-installed in our connector-sdk base imagee.
# NOTE: Do check with Customer Support to implement this or similar installation.sh script file.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.

# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:

# The schema function takes one parameter:
# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.
