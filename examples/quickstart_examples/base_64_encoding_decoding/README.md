# Base64 Encoding and Decoding Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to encode and decode data using `Base64` within a Fivetran Connector SDK implementation. It performs both transformations during a sync and writes the results to the same `USER` table.

This example is useful for:
- Understanding how to handle data that may be Base64-encoded in transit.
- Simulating systems where Base64 is used for transport or obfuscation.
- Testing decoding pipelines and output structure.

The connector upserts two rows per sync:
- One with the original values Base64-encoded.
- One with the values decoded back to their original form.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Demonstrates use of Python’s `base64` module for encoding and decoding.
- Upserts both transformed and original values.
- Uses `op.upsert()` to insert data into the `USER` table.
- Logs each step using SDK's logging module.
- Safely checkpoints sync progress.


## Configuration file
No configuration file is required for this example.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector does not require any Python dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not require authentication - this is a local static example. In a production scenario, use headers or token-based authentication in your request logic within `users_sync.py`.


## Pagination
Not applicable - this connector emits two records per sync.


## Data handling
- The `schema()` function defines the structure of the user table.
- The `update()` function:
  - Encodes values into Base64.
  - Then decodes them back to original values.
  - Upserts both versions sequentially.
- Demonstrates correct encoding/decoding of `UTF-8` strings.


## Error handling
- This example is minimal and does not simulate decoding failures.
- Encoding is performed safely using `.encode("utf-8")` before `base64.b64encode()`.
- You can extend this example to handle invalid `Base64` input gracefully.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `USER` table:

```json
{
  "table": "user",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    "name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING"
  }
}
```
