# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# It shows multiple ways to cast configuration fields to list, integer, boolean and dict for use in connector code.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.

# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#schema
# The schema function takes one parameter:
# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.

            # No columns are defined, meaning the types will be inferred.

# Define the update function, which is a required function, and is called by Fivetran during each sync.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:
# - configuration: dictionary containing any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector.
# - state: a dictionary containing the state checkpointed during the prior sync.
#   The state dictionary is empty for the first sync or for any full re-sync.
