# Decryption Using Configuration Key Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to use the `configuration.json` file to securely pass in a `Base64` encryption key, which is then used to decrypt an encrypted message using the cryptography Python package.

It illustrates:
- How to handle secret keys passed via configuration
- How to use `Fernet` encryption and decryption
- How to safely upsert decrypted content into a Fivetran destination table

This example is ideal for understanding how to handle secrets, encryption, and decryption within the Fivetran Connector SDK environment.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Decrypts a predefined encrypted message using a config-passed key.
- Uses `Fernet` from the cryptography library.
- Upserts the decrypted message to the `CRYPTO` table.
- Uses `schema()` validation to ensure the key is provided.
- Demonstrates safe use of secrets and encoded data.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:
```json
{
  "my_key": "EKlFpH8sZmdhhZ9lGhezgMTwAw3_Y2e7wbco7Gxt3SA="
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:
```
cryptography==44.0.2
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not authenticate to any external system, but it demonstrates how to securely use secrets for decryption within your connector logic.


## Pagination
Not applicable - the connector performs a single transformation on each sync.


## Data handling
- Decryption key is loaded from the config.
- An encrypted message is decrypted using `Fernet`.
- The decoded message is written as a string to the `CRYPTO` table.
- The connector uses `op.upsert()` and `op.checkpoint()` to maintain sync state.


## Error handling
- If the key is missing from configuration, `schema()` raises a `ValueError`.
- Decryption failures will result in a runtime exception (e.g. invalid token format).
- Logs are written using `log.warning()` and `log.fine()` to trace execution.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `CRYPTO` table:

```json
{
  "table": "crypto",
  "primary_key": ["msg"],
  "columns": {
    "msg": "STRING"
  }
}
```
