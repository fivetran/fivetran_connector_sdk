# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# It shows the use of a requirements.txt file and a configuration.json file to pass a credential key into the connector code and use it to decrypt a message.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.

# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#schema
# The schema function takes one parameter:
# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.
def schema(configuration: dict):
    # Check if the 'my_key' is present in the configuration.
    if "my_key" not in configuration:

# Define the update function, which is a required function, and is called by Fivetran during each sync.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:
# - configuration: dictionary containing any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector.
# - state: a dictionary containing the state checkpointed during the prior sync.
#   The state dictionary is empty for the first sync or for any full re-sync.

    # Decrypt the encrypted message using the Fernet object.

    op.upsert(
        table="crypto", data={"msg": message.decode()}  # Decode the decrypted message to a string.
    )

    # Save the progress by checkpointing the state. This is important for ensuring that the sync process can resume
    # from the correct position in case of next sync or interruptions.
    # Learn more about how and where to checkpoint by reading our best practices documentation
    # (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices#largedatasetrecommendation).
