# Configuration form example

## Connector overview

This example demonstrates how to define a connector setup form using `ConfigurationForm`, `form_field`, and `Test` from the Fivetran Connector SDK. It covers all available field types — plain text, password, dropdown, toggle, and descriptive dropdown — and shows how to register a connection test that Fivetran runs when the user clicks **Test Connection** during setup.

The API fields (`api_base_url`, `api_key`) in the configuration form are included to illustrate how a real connector would collect credentials — they are not required for this example to run. The `configuration.json` file provided contains sample values used only to demonstrate the form fields when running locally.

Refer to `def configuration_form()` and `def connection_test()` in `connector.py` for the main setup form and test implementation.

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To run the connector locally:

```bash
fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json
```

## Features

- Demonstrates all available form field types: `TextField` (plain text and password variants), `DropdownField`, `ToggleField`, and `DescriptiveDropdownField`
- Registers a connection test function that Fivetran calls by its `__name__` during connector setup
- Shows how to read and use configuration form values inside `update()`
- Supports full and incremental sync modes, controlled by a form field
- Optionally logs extraction volume when the metrics toggle is enabled
- Supports the `fivetran configuration` command, which interactively prompts for each form field value and generates (or overrides) `configuration.json` — the resulting file can then be used with `fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json` to run the connector locally or with `fivetran deploy` to deploy it. Setup tests registered via `add_test()` can be run independently using `fivetran configuration --test`, which is useful for validating credentials, field values, or connection health without running a full sync

## Requirements file

This connector has no third-party dependencies. The `requirements.txt` file is present but empty.

> Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Data handling

The connector uses hardcoded sample records to illustrate the sync pattern without requiring a live data source. Configuration values from the form are read in `update()` to control sync behavior: `sync_mode` determines whether all records are re-synced or only records added since the last checkpoint, `batch_size` shows how a page limit would be applied, and `enable_metrics` controls whether extraction stats are logged.

Refer to `def update()` for details.

## Additional considerations
