# Hello World Connector Example

## Connector overview
This is the simplest possible connector using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It defines only the `update()` function and emits a single row containing the message "hello, world!" to a table named `HELLO`.

This example is useful as a bare-minimum test or template to:
- Understand connector structure and generator usage.
- Validate SDK setup and basic sync mechanics.
- Experiment with debug-mode execution.

Note: This example omits the `schema()` function and therefore does not explicitly declare column types, which is not recommended for production connectors. See [Best Practices](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/best-practices#declaringprimarykeys) for more.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Implements only the `update()` function.
- Sends a single record with one string field: `"hello, world!"`.
- Uses `op.upsert()` to insert the row.
- Uses `op.checkpoint()` to safely track sync state.


## Configuration file
No configuration file is required for this example.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector does not require any Python dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not require authentication - this connector emits static local data.


## Pagination
Not applicable - no API or iteration logic is present.


## Data handling
- The `update()` function emits one hardcoded row.
- No schema is declared, so Fivetran infers the column name and type automatically.


## Error handling
- No error handling is implemented, as this example does not interact with external systems.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `HELLO` table:

```json
{
  "table": "hello",
  "primary_key": ["_fivetran_id"],
  "columns": {
    "_fivetran": "STRING",
    "message": "STRING"
  }
}
```
