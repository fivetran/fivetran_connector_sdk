# Large Dataset with Pagination Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to handle large paginated datasets from an API using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It connects to the public [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and iteratively fetches Pokémon records in batches using offset-based pagination.

It’s useful for:
- Building connectors for public APIs with large datasets.
- Learning how to manage pagination and state checkpointing.
- Syncing data from a JSON array into a structured destination table.

Each page contains 100 Pokémon records, and the connector continues fetching until no more pages remain.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to a public REST API.
- Uses offset-based pagination (offset, limit).
- Converts API results into a `pandas.DataFrame`.
- Sync rows to Fivetran using `op.upsert()`.
- Uses `op.checkpoint()` to persist the current pagination offset across syncs.


## Configuration file
The connector does not require any configuration parameters.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:
```
pandas==2.2.3
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not authenticate as it accesses a public API.


## Pagination
Pagination is handled using the PokéAPI’s `offset` and `limit` parameters.
- Each page retrieves up to 100 records.
- The `next` field from the API response is used to determine whether more pages remain.
- The offset is stored in the connector state after each page is processed.


## Data handling
- Each Pokémon record contains:
  - `name`: the name of the Pokémon.
  - `url`: the URL to fetch full Pokémon details (not expanded in this example).
- Data is upserted into the `POKEMONS` table row by row.
- The connector uses pandas to build and iterate over tabular rows.


## Error handling
- The connector raises an error if the API request fails or the response cannot be parsed.
- All sync progress is checkpointed after each page via` op.checkpoint(state)` to allow safe resumption.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `POKEMONS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "pokemons",
  "primary_key": [],
  "columns": {
    "name": "STRING",
    "url": "STRING"
  }
}
```
