# Large Dataset Without Pagination Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to handle large dataset responses from an API that does not support traditional pagination. It connects to the public [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and retrieves up to 100,000 Pokémon in a single request, then divides the data into smaller, manageable batches for processing and upserting into the destination.

This pattern is helpful when:
- The API returns a large dataset in a single payload.
- You want to avoid memory issues by processing the data in chunks.
- No `next` or `offset` parameter is available in the response to paginate externally.

Note: For APIs with proper pagination support, use offset or cursor-based pagination patterns instead for more reliable and scalable syncs.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```bash
fivetran init <project-path> --template examples/quickstart_examples/large_data_set/without_pagination
```

`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`. By default, you get a functional example connector to build from. Use the `--template` option to initialize from a community connector for a more complete starting point aligned to your use case. You can also configure the context for the AI assistant of your choice.

| Flag | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"<project path>"` | Optional | Specifies the project path, absolute or relative. If not provided, the command runs in the current directory. |
| `--template <repository path>` | Optional | Specifies the connector example repository path, relative to the `fivetran_connector_sdk` repository. If not provided, the [default template connector](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/tree/main/template_connector) from the `/template_connector` directory is used. |


## Features
- Connects to a public REST API.
- Requests a single large response with up to `100000` records.
- Splits the dataset into manageable `BATCH_SIZE` chunks (default: 100).
- Processes each batch using `pandas.DataFrame.iterrows()`.
- Upserts each row using `op.upsert()`.
- Stores sync progress using `op.checkpoint()` after each batch.


## Configuration file
The connector does not require any configuration parameters.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:
```
pandas==2.2.3
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not authenticate as it accesses a public API.


## Pagination
This API example does not support real pagination, so the connector handles large responses using batching.
- The connector sends one large request to the API.
- The data is received as a single response (`results` list).
- The results are processed using manual slicing into smaller `DataFrame` chunks.


## Data handling
- Each Pokémon record contains:
  - `name`: the name of the Pokémon.
  - `url`: the URL to fetch full Pokémon details (not expanded in this example).
- Data is upserted into the `POKEMONS` table row by row.
- The connector uses pandas to build and iterate over tabular rows.


## Error handling
- If the API request fails, `requests.get()` raises an exception.
- JSON parsing is done safely with `response.json()`.
- Any unhandled exceptions halt the sync and are surfaced in the logs.
- Sync progress is checkpointed after each batch using `op.checkpoint(state)`.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `POKEMONS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "pokemons",
  "primary_key": [],
  "columns": {
    "name": "STRING",
    "url": "STRING"
  }
}
```
