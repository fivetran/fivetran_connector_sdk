# Multiple Code Files with Custom Timestamp Serialization Example

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to build a modular connector using multiple Python files in a Fivetran Connector SDK project. It showcases the use of a `connector.py` and `timestamp_serializer.py`, for handling non-uniform timestamp formats from the source system.

This pattern is ideal when:
- Your source sends timestamps in different formats (e.g. both `yyyy-MM-dd` and `yyyy/MM/dd)`.
- You want to centralize logic for date normalization and reuse it across different sync flows.
- You need to parse raw date strings and convert them into standardized UTC ISO 8601 format.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Handles timestamp fields in multiple formats:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`
  - `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:ss`
- Converts all timestamps to UTC ISO 8601 format, as recommended by Fivetran.
- Organizes serialization logic in a reusable module.
- Emits normalized data to the event table.
- Uses `op.checkpoint()` to persist sync state.


## Configuration file
The connector does not require any configuration parameters.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector does not require any Python dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Not Applicable - this example runs entirely on static test data.


## Pagination
Not applicable - only two records are processed per sync.


## Data handling
- Timestamps are parsed by the `TimestampSerializer` class using two predefined formats.
- Each parsed timestamp is converted to UTC and serialized in ISO 8601 format.
- The `update()` function syncs one row per event.


## Error handling
- If a timestamp string does not match any known format, a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive message.
- Invalid formats are caught early via the `parse_timestamp()` method.
- Logs are recorded using the Fivetran SDK’s Logging module (`log.warning`, `log.fine`).


## Tables Created
The connector creates an `EVENT` table:

```json
{
  "table": "event",
  "primary_key": ["name"],
  "columns": {
    "name": "STRING",
    "timestamp": "UTC_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
