# This example demonstrates how you can write a complex connector comprising multiple .py files.
# This includes the __init__.py which is needed to ensure the timestamp_serializer module is correctly recognized.
# The timestamp_serializer module shown in this example is used to handle scenarios where the source sends timestamps in two different formats.
# It assumes that the source will send timestamps in UTC timezone.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details

# Import required classes from fivetran_connector_sdk
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Operations as op
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Logging as log

# Import self written modules
from timestamp_serializer import TimestampSerializer


# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#schema
# The schema function takes one parameter:
# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.
def schema(configuration: dict):
    return [
        {
            "table": "event",  # Name of the table in the destination.
            "primary_key": ["name"],  # Primary key column(s) for the table.
            "columns": {  # Define the columns and their data types.
                "name": "STRING",  # String column for the name.
                "timestamp": "UTC_DATETIME",  # UTC date-time column for the timestamp
            },
        }
    ]


# Define the update function, which is a required function, and is called by Fivetran during each sync.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:
# - configuration: dictionary contains any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector
# - state: a dictionary contains whatever state you have chosen to checkpoint during the prior sync
# The state dictionary is empty for the first sync or for any full re-sync
def update(configuration: dict, state: dict):
    log.warning("Example: QuickStart Examples - Simple Three Step Cursor")
