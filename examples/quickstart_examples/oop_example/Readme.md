# National Parks Example

This example implements a connector to fetch, process, and store data from the [National Parks Service API (NPS API)](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm). The process is built based on the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, ensuring modular, maintainable, and reusable code. 

---

## Overview

This example retrieves data from the NPS API, processes it, and stores it in a structured format across the following tables:  
- `PARKS`
- `ALERTS`
- `ARTICLES`
- `PEOPLE`

Each table is encapsulated within its own Python file, ensuring single responsibility and clean organization.

The project follows a modular architecture:
- Each table has its own dedicated class for handling schema definitions and data transformations.
- A centralized NPS Client handles API interactions, abstracting away the complexities of HTTP requests.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

---

## Features

- Modular design - each table and the API client are encapsulated in separate files for clarity and reusability
- Scalability - you can easily extend it to accommodate additional tables or API endpoints
- Customizability - you can modify transformations or table structures without affecting unrelated components
- Reliability - includes error handling for API interactions and data processing
- State - does not use incremental sync; all data is fetched and upserted on every sync.”

---
## Configuration file

The example expects a configuration.json file with the following structure:

```plaintext
{"api_key": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"}
```

Note: Ensure that the configuration.json file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

---

## Authentication

The example uses a simple API-key authentication. It reads your NPS API key out of a configuration.json file and then includes it on every request as a query parameter.

---
## Pagination

This example does not use any pagination. 

---
## Data handling

- Schema definition: The connector’s tables and their column schemas are built in the schema(configuration) function (see lines 13–18).
- Data retrieval & processing: On each sync, Fivetran calls update(configuration, state) (see lines 22–27), which instantiates each table handler and calls its process_data() method. Under the hood, process_data() uses the shared fetch_data() helper to pull JSON from the NPS API and then maps it into Python dicts.
- Upsert delivery: For every record returned by process_data(), the connector performs an op.upsert(table.path(), row) operation—handing each row off to Fivetran for insert/update in the destination (see lines 24–27).
- Sync: This example does not use incremental syncs; all data is fetched and upserted on every sync.

#### Query the PARKS table

Run the following query:

```sql

select * from parks

```

### ARTICLES table

The `ARTICLES` table stores educational and informational articles about national parks.

![Articles](images/Articles.png "Articles Table in DB")

#### Query the ARTICLES table

Run the following query:

```sql

select * from articles

```

### ALERTS table

The `ALERTS` table captures active alerts for parks.

#### Query the ALERTS table

Run the following query:

```sql

select * from alerts

```
### PEOPLE table

The `PEOPLE` table lists key figures associated with parks or their history.
