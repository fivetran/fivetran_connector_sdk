# This example implements a **connector** to fetch, process, and store data from the
# National Parks Service API (NPS API)(https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm).
# The process is built with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, ensuring
# modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.
