# Parsing JSON Response in Class Connector Example

## Connector overview
This example connector demonstrates how to fetch JSON data from a public API and map it into a Python dataclass (POJO-style object) for easy parsing and transformation using the fivetran_connector_sdk library. It fetches data from the [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) endpoint and parses it into Python objects. It is a simple demonstration of how to:
- Use `dataclass` to model API responses.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- Map parsed JSON objects to upsert operations.

This pattern is useful for APIs with structured JSON responses and promotes readability and testability.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Converts API JSON responses into structured Python data classes.
- Predefined schema maps the structure of incoming data to Fivetran-compatible tables.
- Uses `op.upsert` to sync and deduplicate data efficiently.


## Configuration file
No configuration file is required for this example, as it connects to a public API.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python dependencies:
```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector does not require authentication - as it connects to a public API that doesn't require any authentication.


## Pagination
Not applicable - as this example fetches all data from a single endpoint without pagination.


## Data handling
- API responses are parsed directly into Python data classes (`Post`) using dataclass for clean and reliable access to fields.
- Data is extracted from the `Post` object and explicitly mapped to expected types (`INT`, `STRING`) before being upserted into the `POSTS` table.
- This simple connector does not use state-based pagination or checkpoints, as the API returns all available records per call.


## Error handling
- Any record that fails deserialization or processing is logged and skipped, preventing sync interruption.
- A capped exponential backoff ensures the connector gracefully retries failed API requests before exiting.


## Tables created
The connector creates the `POSTS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "posts",
  "primary_key": [
    "id"
  ],
  "columns": {
    "id": "INT",
    "userId": "INT",
    "title": "STRING",
    "body": "STRING"
  }
}
```
