# Using pyproject.toml for Dependency Management

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to use a `pyproject.toml` file for dependency management instead of a `requirements.txt` file with the Fivetran Connector SDK.

It fetches the latest exchange rate from the [Frankfurter API](https://frankfurter.dev), a free, open-source API that requires no authentication, and uses the `tenacity` library (declared in `pyproject.toml`) for production-grade API retry logic with exponential backoff.

It illustrates:
- How to declare dependencies in `pyproject.toml` using the PEP 621 standard
- How the Connector SDK automatically detects and uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency installation
- How to use an external library (`tenacity`) declared in `pyproject.toml` for retry handling
- How to fetch data from a live API and upsert it to a destination table


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To initialize a new Connector SDK project using this connector as a starting point, run:

```bash
fivetran init <project-path> --template examples/quickstart_examples/pyproject_toml
```
`fivetran init` initializes a new Connector SDK project by setting up the project structure, configuration files, and a connector you can run immediately with `fivetran debug`.
If you do not specify a project path, Fivetran creates the project in your current directory.
For more information on `fivetran init`, refer to the [Connector SDK `init` documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connector-sdk/setup-guide#createyourcustomconnector).

> Note: Ensure you have updated the `configuration.json` file with the necessary parameters before running `fivetran debug`. See the [Configuration file](#configuration-file) section for details on the required configuration parameters.


## Features
- Demonstrates `pyproject.toml` as an alternative to `requirements.txt` for dependency management.
- Fetches the latest exchange rate from the Frankfurter API.
- Uses `tenacity` for declarative retry logic with exponential backoff (declared in `pyproject.toml`).
- Validates configuration to ensure required parameters are present.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:
```json
{
  "from_currency": "USD",
  "to_currency": "INR"
}
```

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `from_currency` | The base currency code (e.g., `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`) |
| `to_currency` | The target currency code (e.g., `INR`, `JPY`, `CAD`) |

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## pyproject.toml file
This connector uses a `pyproject.toml` file to declare dependencies instead of a `requirements.txt` file. The `pyproject.toml` follows the PEP 621 standard:
```toml
[project]
name = "pyproject-toml-example"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Fivetran connector example demonstrating pyproject.toml for dependency management"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "tenacity>=8.2",
]
```

### Key differences from requirements.txt
| Aspect | requirements.txt | pyproject.toml |
|---|---|---|
| Format | One package per line (e.g., `tenacity>=8.2`) | TOML format under `[project.dependencies]` |
| Metadata | Dependencies only | Project name, version, description, Python version, and dependencies |
| Standard | pip convention | PEP 621 (Python packaging standard) |
| Precedence | Used if no `pyproject.toml` present | Takes precedence over `requirements.txt` |

### Important notes
- If both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` are present in your project, `pyproject.toml` takes precedence.


## Authentication
Not applicable - the Frankfurter API is free and requires no authentication.


## Pagination
Not applicable - the connector fetches only the latest exchange rate in a single API call.


## Data handling
- The connector calls the Frankfurter `/v2/rates/latest` endpoint to get the most recent exchange rate.
- API calls use `tenacity`'s `@retry` decorator for automatic retry with exponential backoff on transient failures.
- If the API returns no records, the connector logs a warning and exits gracefully.
- The exchange rate record is upserted to the `EXCHANGE_RATES` destination table using `op.upsert()`.


## Error handling
- If `from_currency` or `to_currency` is missing from configuration, `validate_configuration()` raises a `ValueError`.
- API request failures (timeouts, network errors, HTTP errors) are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, up to 10s) using `tenacity`.
- After all retry attempts are exhausted, `tenacity` re-raises the last exception, which is caught, logged at `SEVERE` level, and wrapped as a `RuntimeError`.
- If the API returns an empty response, the connector logs a warning and returns without upserting.
- Logs are written using `log.warning()`, `log.info()`, and `log.severe()` to trace execution.


## Tables created
The connector creates an `EXCHANGE_RATES` table:

```json
{
  "table": "exchange_rates",
  "primary_key": ["date", "from_currency", "to_currency"],
  "columns": {
    "date": "NAIVE_DATE",
    "from_currency": "STRING",
    "to_currency": "STRING",
    "rate": "DECIMAL(15,6)"
  }
}
```
