"""
This is an example for how to use pyproject.toml for dependency management with the Fivetran Connector SDK.
Instead of declaring dependencies in a requirements.txt file, this connector uses a pyproject.toml file.
The pyproject.toml file is the modern Python standard for declaring project metadata and dependencies.
The Connector SDK prioritizes pyproject.toml over requirements.txt when both are present.
See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference)
and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.

This connector fetches the latest exchange rates from the Frankfurter API (https://frankfurter.dev),
a free, open-source API that requires no authentication.
