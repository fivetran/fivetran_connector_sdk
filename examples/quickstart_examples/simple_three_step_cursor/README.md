# Simple Three-Step Cursor Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates a minimal use case for implementing a cursor-based sync using the Fivetran Connector SDK. It uses a local list of static data (`SOURCE_DATA`) and syncs one row per run based on a simple cursor stored in the connector's state.

This example is ideal for learning how to:
- Use a basic cursor to track sync progress.
- Emit upserts one row at a time.
- Define a schema with partial column specification.
- Safely checkpoint after each sync.

Note: This connector will sync 3 records across 3 runs. A fourth run will raise a controlled error to simulate end-of-data handling in development.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Uses a hardcoded data source (`SOURCE_DATA`).
- Syncs one record per run using a basic integer cursor.
- Demonstrates `op.upsert()` and `op.checkpoint()` usage.
- Implements a `schema()` function with partial column definition (Fivetran will infer missing types).


## Configuration file
The connector does not require any configuration parameters.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector does not require any Python dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Not Applicable - this connector uses local static data.


## Pagination
Not applicable - this example uses a simple positional cursor (`state["cursor"]`) to control sync flow.


## Data handling
- `SOURCE_DATA` is a list of dictionaries (`records`).
- Only one record is synced per run, based on the current cursor.
- Once all records are synced, a controlled `list index out of range` error is raised.


## Error handling
- If the cursor exceeds the bounds of `SOURCE_DATA`, an exception is raised intentionally to simulate exhaustion.
- State is checkpointed after each successful upsert.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `HELLO_WORLD` table:

```json
{
  "table": "hello_world",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "message": "STRING"
  }
}
```
