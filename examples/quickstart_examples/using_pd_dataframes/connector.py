# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# This example demonstrates how to work with data frames.
# It also shows how to handle NaN values, as we do not support NaN inputs.
# Customers should convert NaN values to None before sending data.
# It shows the use of a requirements.txt file and a connector that calls a publicly available API to get random profile data
