# ZIP Code Weather Connector

## Connector overview

This connector fetches weather forecast data for specified US ZIP codes using two public APIs:
1. Zippopotam.us API - Converts ZIP codes to geographic coordinates
2. National Weather Service (NWS) API - Provides detailed weather forecasts

The connector maintains two tables:
- `forecast`: Contains weather forecast data for each ZIP code
- `zip_code`: Contains metadata about each ZIP code including city, state, and coordinates

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating System:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Fetches weather forecasts for multiple ZIP codes in a single sync
* Maintains historical forecast data with incremental updates
* Uses public APIs with no authentication required
* Provides detailed weather information including temperature, conditions, and wind data
* Includes ZIP code metadata for better data analysis

## Configuration file

The connector requires a simple configuration with a list of ZIP codes to monitor:

```json
{
  "zip_codes": "94612,90210,10001"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector uses minimal external dependencies. The `requirements.txt` file should be empty as all required packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector uses public APIs that do not require authentication:
- Zippopotam.us API is completely public
- NWS API requires only a User-Agent header for identification

## Data handling

The connector processes data in the following way:
1. Converts ZIP codes to coordinates using Zippopotam.us API
2. Fetches forecast data from NWS API using the coordinates
3. Transforms the data into two tables:
   - `forecast`: Contains weather forecast periods with detailed weather information
   - `zip_code`: Contains ZIP code metadata including city, state, and coordinates

The connector uses incremental sync based on the `startTime` field to avoid duplicate data.

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling for:
- Invalid ZIP codes
- API request failures
- Data parsing errors

All errors are logged using the Fivetran logging system for debugging and monitoring.

## Tables Created

The connector creates two tables:

### forecast
Primary key: `startTime`, `zip_code`
Contains weather forecast data including:
- Temperature
- Weather conditions
- Wind information
- Forecast period details

### zip_code
Primary key: `zip_code`
Contains ZIP code metadata including:
- City name
- State
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Additional location details
