# Apache Hive Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector shows how to fetch data from Apache Hive using the `PyHive` and `fivetran-connector-sdk` library. The connector is designed to handle large datasets by processing data in manageable batches and maintaining the sync state to resume from the last successful position.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Direct connection to Apache Hive data source.
- Incremental sync based on the `created_at` timestamp.
- Batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently. This prevents memory overflow and allows for processing of large tables.

## Configuration file

This connector requires the following configuration parameters to establish a connection to your Hive instance:

```
{
  "hostname": "YOUR_HIVE_HOSTNAME",
  "port": "<YOUR_HIVE_PORT>",
  "username": "<YOUR_HIVE_USERNAME>",
  "password": "<YOUR_HIVE_PASSWORD>",
  "database": "<YOUR_HIVE_DATABASE>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

Include the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file:

```
pyhive
thrift_sasl
sasl
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector supports `CUSTOM` authentication for Apache Hive. You need to provide:  
- `hostname`: The address of your Hive server
- `port`: The port number Hive is listening on (typically 10000)
- `username`: Your Hive username
- `password`: Your Hive password

Authentication is handled in the `create_hive_connection` function.

## Data handling

The connector performs the following data handling operations:  
- Fetching: Data is retrieved from Apache Hive using SQL queries with timestamp-based filtering.
- Processing: The `process_row` function converts raw Hive data into dictionary format suitable for Fivetran.
  - Datetime objects are converted to ISO format with UTC timezone.
  - Column names are extracted and mapped to their values.
- Batching: Data is processed in configurable batches (1000 rows by default) to prevent memory overflow. 
- State management: The connector tracks the latest created timestamp to enable incremental syncs.

## Tables created

The connector creates a table named `PEOPLE` with the following schema:

```
{
    "table": "people",
    "primary_key": ["id"],
    "columns": {
        "id": "INT",
        "name": "STRING",
        "age": "INT",
        "created_at": "UTC_DATETIME"
    },
}
```
