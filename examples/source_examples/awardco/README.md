# AwardCo Users Connector Example
AwardCo is an employee recognition platform. The AwardCo API typically exposes RESTful JSON endpoints to manage resources such as users and recognition-related entities. Authentication is performed via an API key supplied in request headers. Common behaviors include paginated responses, timestamp fields for change tracking, and conventional HTTP status codes. 

Refer to [AwardCo documentation](https://www.awardco.com/) for additional details and production configurations.

## Connector overview
This example connector uses the Fivetran Connector SDK to sync AwardCo user data into your destination. It performs incremental syncs based on a timestamp cursor, upserts user rows into a single `USER` table, and emits checkpoints for reliable resumption. There is also a local mock mode for offline development and testing.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Ubuntu 20.04+ / Debian 10+ / Amazon Linux 2+ (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide).

Quick start
1) Copy and edit `awardco-users-connector/configuration.json`.
2) Run a local debug sync:

```
fivetran debug --configuration awardco-users-connector/configuration.json
```

Tip: Set `use_mock` to `"true"` to read from `awardco-users-connector/files/mock_users.json` and avoid network calls.

## Features
- Incremental sync using an ISO-8601 `updated_at` cursor (stored as `last_sync_time`).
- Idempotent upserts into the `user` table with a stable primary key.
- Local mock mode for offline development and deterministic testing.
- Simple state checkpointing at the end of each sync.

## Configuration file
Configuration keys uploaded to Fivetran come from `configuration.json` (string values only):

```
{
  "api_key": "<YOUR_AWADCO_API_KEY>",
  "base_url": "<YOUR_AWADCO_BASE_URL>",
  "rate_limit": ""<YOUR_AWADCO_RATE_LIMIT>",
  "use_mock": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>"
}
```

Validation rules
- `api_key` (required): AwardCo API key.
- `base_url` (required): AwardCo API base URL. Do not include a trailing `/api` because the connector appends the endpoint path (for example, `/api/users`).
- `rate_limit` (optional): User-provided hint; not enforced by code.
- `use_mock` (optional): When `true`, reads `files/mock_users.json` instead of calling the API.

- Config usage — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:58`

## Requirements file
This example does not require external libraries at runtime for the connector itself. The provided `requirements.txt` is intentionally minimal.

Example (optional dev tooling):

```
# requirements.txt
# Add optional tools only if needed for local development
# Faker can be used to generate mock data, but is not required by the connector
Faker
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk` and `requests` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. Do not declare them in `requirements.txt` to avoid conflicts.

## Authentication
This connector uses an API key. The request includes the key in the `apiKey` header when calling the AwardCo API.

Steps
1. Obtain an API key from your AwardCo administrator or developer portal.
2. Set `api_key` in `configuration.json`.
3. Set `base_url` (for example, `https://api.awardco.com`).

## Pagination
The sample implementation targets a single users endpoint and does not implement pagination. If the AwardCo API responds with paginated results, extend `update` to request subsequent pages and upsert each batch.

For inspiration, see the mock utilities that simulate a `has_more` flag:
- `awardco-users-connector/mock_responses.py:84`
- `awardco-users-connector/mock_api.py:33`

## Data handling
- Table mapping: all user records are upserted into the `user` table.
- Primary key: `employeeId`.
- Incremental field: `updated_at` (the maximum value is stored as `last_sync_time`).
- State management: the connector writes a checkpoint with `last_sync_time` after processing.

References
- Upserts — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:76`
- Cursor tracking — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:61` and `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:80`
- Checkpoint — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:83`

## Error handling
The connector validates configuration and wraps network and processing steps in a try/except, surfacing failures with a clear error message. Logging uses the SDK logger for observability.

Examples
- Startup log — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:54`
- Config validation — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:13`
- Error propagation — `awardco-users-connector/connector.py:86`

Recommendations
- Add `log.severe(...)` on critical failures where appropriate.
- Consider retries and rate-limit handling if the AwardCo API enforces limits.

## Tables created
- `user` — Primary key: `employeeId`.

Example fields: `employeeId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `balance`, `currencyCode`, `updated_at`, `created_at`.

After a debug run, validate the DuckDB output (default: `warehouse.db`) and check operation counts in the CLI summary.
