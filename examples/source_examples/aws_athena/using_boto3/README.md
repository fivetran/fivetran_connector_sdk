# AWS Athena Connector Example - Using Boto3

## Connector overview
This example demonstrates how to sync data from Amazon Athena into a Fivetran destination table using the Fivetran Connector SDK and the `boto3` AWS SDK for Python. The connector executes a query against Athena, polls for the result, and streams the resulting rows using `op.upsert()`.

This pattern is ideal for:
- Syncing query results from Athena-backed datasets.
- Working with large result sets using paginated tokens (`NextToken`).
- Handling cloud data access via AWS credentials.

Note: You must provide your AWS credentials and an S3 staging location for Athena query results.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to AWS Athena using `boto3`.
- Starts a query execution and polls until complete.
- Uses `get_query_results()` to fetch paginated results using NextToken.
- Transforms Athena records into Python-native types.
- Uses `op.upsert()` to sync rows into the customers table.
- Uses `op.checkpoint()` to persist state.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "aws_access_key_id": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
  "aws_secret_access_key": "<YOUR_AWS_SECRETS_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "region_name": "<YOUR_REGION_NAME>",
  "database_name": "<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>",
  "s3_staging_dir": "<YOUR_S3_STAGING_DIRECTORY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
boto3
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
AWS authentication is handled via the `boto3.client()` function using the credentials provided in the configuration file. Make sure these credentials are secure and limited in scope (e.g., read-only access).


## Pagination
The connector handles paginated Athena results using `NextToken`:
- It skips the first row (header).
- If `NextToken` is present, it fetches the next page.
- Continues until all rows are processed.


## Data handling
- Query string: `SELECT * FROM test_rows`.
- Response rows are transformed and emitted to the `CUSTOMERS` table.
- Supported Athena data types include `VarCharValue`, `BigIntValue`, `DoubleValue`, `BooleanValue`.
- Null fields are handled and converted to Python `None`.


## Error handling
- If Athena query fails, the sync ends and prints the failure state.
- The connector checks for terminal statuses: `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`.
- All paginated results are safely streamed with yield.
- You can enhance it by:
  - Adding timeout logic for long-running queries.
  - Adding retry handling for transient AWS errors.


## Tables Created
The connector creates a `CUSTOMERS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "customers",
  "primary_key": ["customer_id"],
  "columns": {
    "customer_id": "STRING",
    "first_name": "STRING",
    "last_name": "STRING",
    "email": "STRING"
  }
}
```
