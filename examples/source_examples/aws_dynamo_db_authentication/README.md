# AWS DynamoDB Connector Using IAM Role Authentication

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to sync data from Amazon DynamoDB using the Fivetran Connector SDK and AWS IAM role-based authentication. It authenticates using assumed IAM roles via STS, discovers all tables, extracts their primary keys dynamically, and syncs each table using a parallel scan.

This example highlights:
- Authenticating with AWS via role assumption.
- Dynamically generating schema from DynamoDB metadata.
- Efficient record fetching with `aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan`.
- Safely syncing multiple tables in a single connector.

Refer to [Boto3 DynamoDB Docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html) for more detail on AWS client behavior.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Uses `boto3` STS to assume a role for DynamoDB access.
- Discovers all available tables using `list_tables()`.
- Dynamically builds schema by querying each table’s key schema.
- Uses `aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan` to perform fast, concurrent scans.
- Syncs paginated records via `op.upsert()`.
- Checkpoints sync state using `op.checkpoint()`.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
  "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "ROLE_ARN": "<YOUR_ROLE_ARN>",
  "REGION": "<YOUR_REGION>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan==1.1.0
boto3==1.37.4
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
This connector authenticates by:
- Using `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to create an STS client.
- Calling `sts.assume_role()` with the `ROLE_ARN`.
- Using the assumed role’s credentials to access DynamoDB.


## Pagination
Pagination is handled via:
- `aws_dynamodb_parallel_scan.get_paginator(`)
- Parallel scanning with `TotalSegments=4` and `Limit=10` per page.


## Data handling
- Schema is inferred by calling `describe_table()` on each table.
- Keys and values from each DynamoDB record are normalized using `map_item()`.
- Nested arrays are converted to strings.
- All tables are synced in parallel and checkpointed.


## Error handling
- Errors during schema discovery or sync are logged with `log.severe()`.
- Exceptions are re-raised to surface failures in the connector.
- You can extend error handling with retry/backoff for robustness.


## Tables created
The connector creates a `CUSTOMERS` table:

```json
{
  "table": "customers",
  "primary_key": ["customer_id"],
  "columns": "inferred"
}
```
