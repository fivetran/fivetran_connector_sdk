# Couchbase Magma Connector Example
This connector example demonstrates how to sync data from a self-managed Couchbase Server (local, on-premises, or self-hosted in the cloud) using the Magma storage engine with the Connector SDK. 
It connects to a Couchbase instance, runs SQL++ (N1QL) queries to retrieve data from a specified Magma bucket, scope, and collection, and streams the results efficiently to a destination tableâ€”following best practices for handling large datasets.

>For syncing data from a Magma bucket on Couchbase Capella, please refer to the [Couchbase Capella connector example](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/examples/source_examples/couchbase_capella).

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Connect to Couchbase instances using secure authentication
- Execute SQL++ (N1QL) queries against Couchbase Magma bucket collections
- Stream data efficiently to handle large datasets. This prevents any potential memory overflow errors.
- Implement regular checkpointing

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters to connect to your Couchbase instance:

```
{
    "username": "YOUR_COUCHBASE_USERNAME",
    "password": "YOUR_COUCHBASE_PASSWORD",
    "endpoint": "YOUR_COUCHBASE_ENDPOINT",
    "bucket_name": "YOUR_COUCHBASE_BUCKET_NAME",
    "scope": "YOUR_COUCHBASE_SCOPE_NAME",
    "collection": "YOUR_COUCHBASE_COLLECTION_NAME",
    "use_tls": "<true/false>",  # Optional, defaults to false, required if couchbase instance requires TLS
    "cert_path": "PATH_TO_YOUR_TLS_CERTIFICATE"  # Optional, required if use_tls is true
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector requires the Couchbase Python SDK:

```
couchbase==4.3.6
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector authenticates with Couchbase using a username and password authentication mechanism. These credentials are provided in the configuration file and used to create a `PasswordAuthenticator` object for establishing a secure connection to the Couchbase cluster.

## Data handling

The connector handles data processing through the following steps:  
- Establishes a connection to the Couchbase cluster using the provided credentials.
- Executes a `SQL++` query against the specified collection.
- Streams the query results to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory
- Uses the `op.upsert()` method to sync data using Fivetran connector SDK.
- Implements checkpointing every 1000 records to ensure sync progress is saved in case of any interruptions.

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling in several critical functions:  
- In `create_couchbase_client`: Catches any exception during cluster connection and raises a meaningful error message.
- In `execute_query_and_upsert`: Catches exceptions during query execution and data processing, raising descriptive runtime errors.

## Tables created

The `schema()` function defines the structure of the destination table:

```
{
    "table": "airline_table",
    "primary_key": ["id"],
    "columns": {
        "id": "INT",
        "name": "STRING",
        "country": "STRING",
        "type": "STRING",
        "callsign": "STRING",
        "iata": "STRING",
        "icao": "STRING",
        "created_at": "UTC_DATETIME",
    },
}
```
The table contains `airline` information from the Couchbase `travel-sample` bucket.
