# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# The code will retrieve data from tables in a Firebird DB, based on the tables defined in the schema.py file
# You will need to provide your own Firebird DB and credentials for this to work --> see configuration.json
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details
