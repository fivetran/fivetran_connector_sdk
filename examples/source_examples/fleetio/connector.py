# This is an example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# This example shows how to sync data from the Fleetio API using the Fivetran Connector SDK.
# This example was built by the Fleetio team, who approved adding it to this repository.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details

# Import required classes from fivetran_connector_sdk
# For supporting Connector operations like Update() and Schema()
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector

# For enabling Logs in your connector code
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Logging as log

# For supporting Data operations like Upsert(), Update(), Delete() and checkpoint()
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Operations as op

# Import required libraries
import json  # For working with JSON data
from typing import List, Dict  # For type hinting and annotations
from flatten_json import (
    flatten,
)  # This is needed to transform a nested JSON data structure into a flat, one-level structure
import requests  # This is needed to make HTTP requests to the Fleetio API
