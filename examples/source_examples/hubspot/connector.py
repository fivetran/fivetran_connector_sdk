# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# The code will retrieve data for specific event type(s) from Hubspot and create one table per event type
# You can modify this so that all event types write to one table if desired
# You will need to provide your own Hubspot credentials for this to work --> "api_token" in configuration.json
# You can also define how far back in history to go on initial sync using the "initial_sync_start_date" in configuration.json
# Relevant Hubspot API documentation: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/analytics-and-events/event-analytics
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)

# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:

# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:

# 3. Continues fetching and processing data from the API until all pages are processed.
