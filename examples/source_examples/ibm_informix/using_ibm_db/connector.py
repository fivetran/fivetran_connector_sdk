# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# It defines an `update` method, which upserts data from an IBM Informix database.

# Import required classes from fivetran_connector_sdk
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector  # For supporting Connector operations like Update() and Schema()
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Logging as log  # For enabling Logs in your connector code
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Operations as op  # For supporting Data operations like Upsert(), Update(), Delete() and checkpoint()

# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
