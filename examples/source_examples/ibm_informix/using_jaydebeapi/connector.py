# This is an example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# It fetches the data from IBM Informix database using JayDeBeApi package and upserts it using Fivetran Connector SDK.
# It requires the Informix JDBC driver and BSON library to be installed in the environment using installation.sh script.

# NOTE: Do check with Customer Support to implement this or similar installation.sh script file.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details.
