# InfluxDB Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector enables data synchronization from InfluxDB using Fivetran Connector SDK. It connects to an InfluxDB instance, retrieves time-series data from a specified measurement, and syncs it into destination. The connector supports incremental syncs by tracking the last synced timestamp, ensuring that only new or updated data is processed in subsequent syncs. 

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Streams data from InfluxDB using Apache Arrow Flight for efficient data processing
- Supports incremental syncs based on timestamp tracking
- Handles timezone conversion for timestamp data
- Memory-efficient processing of large datasets through data chunking

## Configuration file

The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "token": "<YOUR_INFLUXDB_TOKEN>",
  "org": "<YOUR_INFLUXDB_ORGANIZATION_NAME>",
  "hostname": "<YOUR_INFLUXDB_HOST_URL>",
  "database": "<YOUR_INFLUXDB_DATABASE_NAME>",
  "measurement": "<YOUR_INFLUXDB_MEASUREMENT_NAME>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector requires the influxdb3_python package to connect to InfluxDB.

Content of requirements.txt:

```
influxdb3_python
pandas
```

`influxdb3_python` is a lightweight Python client for InfluxDB 3.x, which provides an easy way to interact with InfluxDB instances. It supports basic operations like querying and writing data.

`pandas` is used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the nanosecond timestamps returned by InfluxDB. It is required in the production environment for safely converting microseconds to datetime.datetime.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector uses token-based authentication with InfluxDB. You'll need to:  
- Log into your InfluxDB dashboard
- Navigate to `Data` > `API Tokens`
- Create a new token with appropriate read permissions
- Copy the token to the token field in your configuration.json file

Refer to `create_influx_client` function in the `connector.py` for implementation details.

## Data handling

The connector processes data as follows:  
- Executes a SQL query against the specified InfluxDB measurement
- Processes the returned data in chunks using Apache Arrow RecordBatch
- Converts timestamps to UTC ISO format for standardization
- Maintains state to track progress and support incremental syncs

Refer to `execute_query_and_upsert` and `upsert_record_batch` functions for implementation details.

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling in several ways:  
- Configuration validation to ensure all required parameters are provided
- Exception handling during client connection
- Runtime error raising with descriptive messages
- Logging at various levels (info, warning) for operational visibility

## Tables Created

The connector creates a single table named `census_table` with the following schema:  

```json
{
    "table": "census_table",
    "primary_key": [],
    "columns": {
        "ants": "INT",
        "bees": "INT",
        "location": "STRING",
        "time": "STRING"
    },
}
```

Refer to the `schema` function for implementation details.

The data in `census_table` looks like this:

| ants | bees | location | time                        | _fivetran_id | _fivetran_synced              | _fivetran_deleted |
|------|------|----------|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
