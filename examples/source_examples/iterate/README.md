# Iterate NPS Survey Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector extracts NPS survey data from [Iterate](https://iteratehq.com/) REST API and loads it into your Fivetran destination. The connector fetches NPS surveys and their individual responses, providing complete survey analytics data for downstream analysis.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
    - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
    - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
    - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Extracts survey metadata from `/surveys` endpoint
- Extracts individual survey responses from `/surveys/{id}/responses` endpoint
- **Incremental sync support**: Uses `start_date` parameter with strict UTC format validation
- **Automatic pagination handling**: Processes all paginated data using links object within single sync
- **Retry logic**: Implements exponential backoff for API reliability (3 retries with progressive delays)
- **Data transformation**: Flattens nested JSON structures into table columns automatically
- **State management**: Simple checkpointing only at successful sync completion
- **UTC datetime enforcement**: Strict format validation eliminates timezone ambiguity

## Configuration file
The configuration requires your Iterate API access token and optionally a start date for initial sync.

```
{
  "api_token": "<YOUR_ITERATE_API_TOKEN>",
  "start_date": "<YOUR_OPTIONAL_START_DATE>"
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `api_token` (required): Your Iterate API access token from your settings page
- `start_date` (optional): UTC datetime in ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix (e.g., "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"). If not provided, sync starts from EPOCH time (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) to capture all historical data

**Sync Behavior:**
- **First Sync**: Uses `start_date` if provided, otherwise starts from EPOCH time (captures all historical data)
- **Subsequent Syncs**: Always incremental from the last successful sync timestamp stored in state
- **State Management**: Contains only `last_survey_sync` timestamp for clean, reliable state tracking
- **Checkpointing**: Only occurs at successful completion to prevent data gaps from partial syncs
- **UTC Consistency**: All timestamps use consistent UTC format with 'Z' suffix throughout

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
The requirements.txt file specifies additional Python libraries required by the connector. Following Fivetran best practices, this connector doesn't require additional dependencies.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
The connector uses API Key authentication via the `x-api-key` header. To obtain your API access token:

1. Log into your Iterate account.
2. Navigate to your account settings page.
3. Find and copy your API access token.
4. Add the token to your `configuration.json` file as shown above.

## Pagination
The connector handles pagination automatically using the Iterate API's `links` object structure. When the API returns a `links.next` URL, the connector continues fetching additional pages until all data is retrieved within a single sync operation.

**Pagination Strategy:**
- **Within-sync pagination**: Each sync processes all paginated data completely using `fetch_survey_responses()`
- **No cross-sync state**: Pagination state is not persisted between sync runs for cleaner state management
- **Incremental filtering**: Uses the `start_date` Unix timestamp parameter to filter responses from API directly
- **Complete processing**: Each sync fetches all relevant data from start_date to current time

The `fetch_survey_responses()` function handles both initial requests and paginated follow-ups using the appropriate API call method.

## Data handling
The connector processes data in two main steps with optimized incremental sync:

- **Survey Data**: Fetches all surveys using `/surveys` endpoint and flattens nested JSON structures into columns
- **Response Data**: For each survey, fetches individual responses using `/surveys/{id}/responses` endpoint with date-based filtering and automatic pagination

**Enhanced Sync Strategy:**
- **Initial Sync**: Uses `start_date` from configuration (if provided) or EPOCH time (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) as a fallback
- **Incremental Syncs**: Uses `last_survey_sync` timestamp from state to fetch only new responses since last successful sync
- **UTC Consistency**: All datetime operations use UTC timezone with 'Z' suffix format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
- **Single Checkpoint**: State is saved only after complete successful sync to prevent data gaps from partial failures

**Data Transformation:**
- **JSON Flattening**: Nested dictionaries become underscore-separated columns (e.g., `author.id` â†’ `author_id`)
- **List Handling**: Arrays are converted to JSON strings for storage
- **Foreign Keys**: Each response includes `survey_id` field to maintain survey relationship
- **Type Safety**: Configuration validation ensures required fields exist before processing

**Key Functions:**
- `parse_iso_datetime_to_unix()`: Handles strict UTC datetime parsing with validation
- `make_iterate_api_call()`: Centralized API calling with common headers and error handling
- `flatten_dict()`: Recursive JSON structure flattening for table columns
- `validate_configuration()`: Comprehensive config validation with datetime format checking

The connector maintains clean state with only `last_survey_sync` timestamp, automatically advancing after each successful sync to ensure reliable incremental processing without data duplication or gaps.

## Error handling
The connector implements comprehensive error handling with multiple layers of protection:

**Configuration Validation (`validate_configuration()`):**
- Validates required `api_token` field exists and is not empty
- Enforces strict UTC datetime format for optional `start_date` (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
- Provides clear error messages for configuration issues with format examples

**API Request Resilience (`make_api_request()`):**
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts with progressive delays)
- Handles HTTP errors, timeouts, and network issues gracefully
- Detailed logging for debugging API connectivity problems

**Centralized API Logic (`make_iterate_api_call()`):**
- Consistent header management and authentication for all API calls
- Automatic API version parameter inclusion
- Unified error handling across all endpoints

**Data Processing Safeguards:**
- Graceful handling of missing or malformed API response structures
- Safe dictionary access patterns to prevent KeyError exceptions
- Proper exception propagation with descriptive RuntimeError messages

**Datetime Handling:**
- Strict UTC format parsing with clear validation messages
- Fallback to EPOCH time for invalid datetime configurations
- Consistent timezone handling throughout the connector

All exceptions are caught at the top level and re-raised as `RuntimeError` with descriptive messages, making troubleshooting easier for users and Fivetran support.

## Tables created
The connector creates two main tables with flattened column structures:

### SURVEY
Contains survey metadata and configuration with all nested JSON properties flattened into individual columns using underscore separation.
- **Primary key**: `id`
- **Structure**: All survey properties from Iterate API flattened (e.g., `author.id` becomes `author_id`)

### RESPONSE
Contains individual survey responses with relationship to parent survey and flattened response data.
- **Primary key**: `id`
- **Foreign key**: `survey_id` (links to `SURVEY` table)
- **Structure**: All response properties flattened, including question answers and user metadata
