# Microsoft Excel File Example

## Connector overview

This connector fetches Microsoft Excel files from AWS S3 and processes them using three different methods to extract the data:
- `pandas` library,
- `python-calamine` library, and
- `openpyxl` library.

It's designed to efficiently handle Excel files of various sizes, providing flexibility for different data processing needs.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating System:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Retrieves Excel file from AWS S3 buckets
- Processes Excel data using three different methods:
  - Pandas - suitable for small to medium-sized files
  - Python-calamine - memory-efficient for larger files
  - Openpyxl - read-only mode for memory efficiency
- Creates three destination tables with identical schemas
- Handles proper cleanup of temporary files

## Configuration file

The connector requires AWS S3 credentials and file information:

```
{
  "aws_access_key_id": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "aws_secret_access_key": "<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY>",
  "region_name": "<YOUR_AWS_REGION>",
  "bucket_name": "<YOUR_S3_BUCKET>",
  "file_name": "<path/to/your/file.xlsx>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector requires the following Python packages:

```
boto3==1.38.14
pandas==2.2.3
openpyxl
python-calamine
```

In order to use the `calamine` engine with `pandas` library, you need to include the `python-calamine` package and ensure that the `pandas` version is `equal to or above 2.2`.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector authenticates with AWS using an access key ID and secret access key. These credentials must have permissions to read objects from the specified S3 bucket. You can create these credentials in the AWS IAM console.  To set up authentication:  
- Create an IAM user with S3 read access
- Generate an access key and secret key for this user
- Add these credentials to your configuration.json file

## Data handling

The connector processes Excel files using three different methods:  
1. Pandas (Refer to `upsert_using_pandas` function): Loads the entire Excel file into memory, which is suitable for small to medium-sized files.  
2. Python-calamine (Refer to `upsert_using_calamine` function): Uses the calamine engine which is more memory-efficient and recommended for large files.  
3. Openpyxl (Refer to `upsert_using_openpyxl` function): Uses read-only mode for better memory efficiency when processing large files.  

Data from each method is upserted into separate tables with identical schemas.

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling in several areas:  
- Configuration validation: Checks if all required keys are present in the configuration.  
- File download: Captures exceptions during S3 file download and raises a RuntimeError with details.  
- Data processing: Wraps the data processing operations in a try-except block to capture and report errors.  

## Tables Created

The connector creates three tables in your destination:

- `excel_data_pandas` : Contains data upserted using the `pandas` library.
- `excel_data_calamine`: Contains data upserted using the `calamine` engine with `pandas`.
- `excel_data_openpyxl`: Contains data upserted using the `openpyxl` library.

The schema for all three tables is identical, with the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each row.
- `name`: Name of the person.
- `age`: Age of the person.
- `country`: Country of residence.
- `email`: Email address of the person.
- `timestamp`: Record timestamp.
