# This is an example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# This example demonstrates how to create a connector that connects to a Neo4j database and syncs data from it.
# It uses the public twitter database available at neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7687.
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
