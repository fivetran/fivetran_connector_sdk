## Configuration file

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDANCE: For production deployments, we recommend using **GitHub secrets** configured in the GitHub Actions workflow. Local configuration files can be used for development and testing, but we encourage using GitHub secrets for production environments.

### Basic configuration

For production deployments, we recommend configuring these as **GitHub secrets** (see [Deployment](#deployment) section). For local development and testing, you can define them in `configuration.json`:

```json
{
  "api_key": "NRAK-ABC123DEF456",
  "account_id": "123456789",
  "region": "US",
  "sync_frequency_minutes": "YOUR_SYNC_FREQUENCY_MINUTES",
  "initial_sync_days": "YOUR_INITIAL_SYNC_DAYS",
  "max_records_per_query": "YOUR_MAX_RECORDS_PER_QUERY",
  "enable_apm_data": "YOUR_ENABLE_APM_DATA",
  "enable_infrastructure_data": "YOUR_ENABLE_INFRASTRUCTURE_DATA",
  "enable_browser_data": "YOUR_ENABLE_BROWSER_DATA",
  "enable_mobile_data": "YOUR_ENABLE_MOBILE_DATA",
  "enable_synthetic_data": "YOUR_ENABLE_SYNTHETIC_DATA",
  "timeout_seconds": "YOUR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS",
  "retry_attempts": "YOUR_RETRY_ATTEMPTS",
  "retry_delay_seconds": "YOUR_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS",
  "data_quality_threshold": "YOUR_DATA_QUALITY_THRESHOLD",
  "alert_on_errors": "YOUR_ALERT_ON_ERRORS",
  "log_level": "YOUR_LOG_LEVEL"
}
```

Required configuration keys:
- `api_key`: New Relic API key for NerdGraph API access (must start with NRAK-)
- `account_id`: New Relic account ID for data extraction

Optional configuration keys:
- `region`: New Relic region (US or EU, defaults to US)
- `sync_frequency_minutes`: Sync frequency in minutes (1-1440, defaults to 15)
- `initial_sync_days`: Days of historical data for initial sync (1-365, defaults to 90)
- `max_records_per_query`: Maximum records per API query (1-10000, defaults to 1000)
- `enable_*_data`: Enable/disable specific data sources (defaults to true)
- `timeout_seconds`: API request timeout (5-300, defaults to 30)
- `retry_attempts`: Number of retry attempts on failure (0-10, defaults to 3)
- `retry_delay_seconds`: Delay between retry attempts (defaults to 5)
- `data_quality_threshold`: Data quality threshold for alerts (0-1, defaults to 0.95)
- `alert_on_errors`: Enable error alerting (defaults to true)
- `log_level`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, SEVERE, defaults to INFO)

## Production vs Development Configuration

### Production deployment (Recommended)
- Method: GitHub Actions workflow with GitHub secrets
- Security: Credentials stored securely in GitHub
- Automation: Push-to-deploy workflow
- Compliance: Enterprise-grade security practices

### Development & Testing (Available)
- Method: Local `configuration.json` or environment variables
- Security: Credentials stored locally (never commit to repository)
- Use case: Local development, debugging, testing
- Guidance: We recommend using GitHub secrets for production

Security note: For production deployments, we recommend using **GitHub secrets**. Local configuration files are available for development but we encourage using GitHub secrets for production environments.

Note: We recommend keeping the `configuration.json` file out of version control to protect sensitive information. You can add it to your `.gitignore` file for additional security.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector for New Relic API integration and data processing.

Example content of `requirements.txt`:

```
fivetran-connector-sdk>=2.0.0
requests>=2.28.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` package (v2.0.0+) is pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`. 

## Authentication

The connector uses New Relic API keys to authenticate the connector with the NerdGraph API.

To obtain API credentials:
1. Log in to your New Relic account.
2. Go to **API Keys**.
3. Create a new API key with the following permissions:
  - NerdGraph API access for querying monitoring data.
  - Account-level access for the specified account ID.

Note: For production connectors, we recommend adding credentials as GitHub Secrets (see [Deployment](#deployment) section). For test connectors, you can add credentials to `configuration.json`.

## Pagination

The connector handles data retrieval from New Relic NerdGraph API with efficient pagination:

- NRQL queries: Limited to 1000 results per query with time-based filtering
- Entity search: Supports cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- Data volume Management: Uses appropriate time ranges to manage data volume
- Incremental syncs: Implements incremental syncs to reduce data transfer

The connector implements efficient data handling by:
- Processing complete API responses in memory
- Using appropriate time ranges to manage data volume
- Implementing incremental syncs to reduce data transfer
- Applying filters to focus on relevant data subsets

Refer to functions `get_apm_data`, `get_infrastructure_data`, `get_browser_data`, `get_mobile_data`, and `get_synthetic_data` in `connector.py` for the data retrieval implementation.

## Dynamic time range management

The connector intelligently manages data fetching based on sync type:

### Initial sync
- Time range: Last 90 days of data
- Use case: First-time setup or full re-sync
- Data volume: Comprehensive historical data for baseline analysis

### Incremental sync
- Time range: Data since last successful sync timestamp
- Use case: Regular scheduled syncs
- Data volume: Only new/changed data since last sync
- Benefits: Faster sync times, reduced API calls, efficient resource usage

### Implementation details
- State management: Uses Fivetran's checkpoint system to track last sync time
- Automatic detection: Automatically determines sync type based on state
- Flexible queries: All NRQL queries dynamically adjust time ranges
- Logging: Clear indication of sync type and time ranges in logs

## Data handling

The connector processes New Relic monitoring data through several stages:

1. Data extraction: Direct GraphQL queries to NerdGraph endpoints.
2. Data transformation: Conversion of New Relic API responses to structured table format.
3. Schema mapping: Consistent data types and column naming across all tables.
4. State management: Checkpoint-based incremental sync support.
5. Error handling: Comprehensive error handling with logging and validation.

Data Processing Features:
- Type conversion: New Relic API responses converted to appropriate data types
- Default values: Missing dimensions populated with appropriate defaults
- Timestamp handling: ISO format timestamp conversion and period-based grouping
- Data aggregation: Multiple metric aggregations (averages, counts, percentages)
- Filtering: Service and account-level filtering based on configuration
- Dynamic time ranges: Intelligent time range selection for initial vs incremental syncs

Data Flow:
New Relic NerdGraph API → Requests Client → Dynamic Time Range Processing → Data Processing Functions → Fivetran Operations → Data Warehouse Tables

Refer to functions `get_time_range`, `execute_nerdgraph_query`, `get_apm_data`, `get_infrastructure_data`, `get_browser_data`, `get_mobile_data`, and `get_synthetic_data` in `connector.py` for detailed data handling logic.

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies to ensure robust operation:

Configuration validation errors:
- ValueError: Missing required configuration values (`api_key`, `account_id`, `region`)
- ValueError: Invalid API key format (must start with `NRAK-`)
- ValueError: Invalid region specification (must be `US` or `EU`)

API request errors:
- RequestException: Handles network timeouts, connection errors, and HTTP failures
- RuntimeError: Manages API request failures and query execution errors

Sync operation errors:
- RuntimeError: Handles general sync failures with detailed error messages
- Logging: Uses Fivetran's logging system with info and severe levels for comprehensive reporting

Error handling implementation:
- Early validation: Configuration parameters validated before API calls
- Exception propagation: Errors are logged and re-raised for Fivetran to handle
- State preservation: Checkpoint system maintains sync state across failures

Refer to functions `validate_configuration`, `execute_nerdgraph_query`, and the main `update` function in `connector.py` for error handling implementation.
