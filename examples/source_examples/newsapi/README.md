# News API Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to use the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) with the Fivetran Connector SDK to retrieve and sync articles related to specific topics. You can configure multiple topics, each of which will be queried and synced into a single table `ARTICLE`.

This connector supports:
- Time-windowed incremental syncs using `occurredAfter` and `occurredBefore`.
- Topic-based filtering of news articles.
- Pagination with `page` and `pageSize` to handle large result sets.
- Safe handling of nested and optional fields.

This example uses the [News API's /v2/everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) endpoint and assumes an active API key (free or paid).


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Syncs articles per topic into a shared table.
- Uses date-based incremental replication via `occurredAfter` and `occurredBefore`.
- Handles paginated responses (`page`, `pageSize`).
- Converts nested structures into flat key-value pairs.
- Uses `op.upsert()` and `op.checkpoint()` to track state and emit records.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
    "API_KEY": "<your_api_key from newsAPI>",
    "pageSize": "100",
    "topic": "[\"Artificial Intelligence\", \"Michigan\", \"Taylor Swift\"]"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
The connector uses a Bearer token for authentication.


## Pagination
Pagination is implemented using the News API's `page` and `pageSize` parameters. It continues until:
- All pages are retrieved.
- Or the temporary dev limit of 100 results is reached.


## Data handling
Each article contains fields such as:
- source.name
- publishedAt
- author
- title
- description
- content
- url 

The connector flattens nested dictionaries and handles missing or optional values gracefully.


## Error handling
- HTTP errors are raised via `raise_for_status()`.
- Sync failures are logged with full stack traces.
- Missing config values (`topic`, `API_KEY`) raise explicit `ValueError`.
- Paginated state is checkpointed after each page and topic sync.


## Tables Created
The connector creates an `ARTICLE` table:

```json
{
  "table": "article",
  "primary_key": ["source", "published_at"],
  "columns": {
    "source": "STRING",
    "published_at": "UTC_DATETIME",
    "author": "STRING",
    "title": "STRING"
  }
}

```
