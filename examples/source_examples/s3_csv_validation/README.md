# S3 CSV File Reader with Data Validation Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to retrieve a CSV file from an Amazon S3 bucket, validate its contents, and sync the records into a destination table using the Fivetran Connector SDK.

Key features include:
- Reading and parsing CSV data using `pandas`.
- Field-level validation for multiple data types (INT, BOOLEAN, STRING, JSON, DATE, DATETIME).
- Skipping invalid rows with helpful error messages.
- Using AWS credentials to securely access private S3 buckets.

This example is ideal for:
- Validating and syncing files uploaded by external systems.
- Handling semi-structured input with field-type enforcement.
- Ingesting flat-file data from cloud object storage.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to Amazon S3 using `boto3`.
- Reads a CSV file and loads it into a DataFrame.
- Validates:
  - Integers (`int`)
  - Longs (`int`)
  - Booleans (`true`/`false`)
  - Strings (non-empty)
  - JSON fields (stringified)
  - Naive dates (`%Y-%m-%d`)
  - Naive datetimes (`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`)
- Skips and logs invalid rows.
- Upserts valid rows into a table called `DATA`.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "aws_access_key_id": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
  "aws_secret_access_key": "<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>",
  "region_name": "<YOUR_AWS_REGION_NAME>",
  "bucket_name": "<YOUR_AWS_BUCKET_NAME>",
  "file_key": "<YOUR_AWS_FILE_KEY>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
boto3==1.35.97
pandas==2.2.3
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Authentication is handled via standard AWS credentials passed into the `boto3.client()` constructor.


## Pagination
Not Applicable for this connector, as it processes a single CSV file.


## Data handling
- CSV is read into a `pandas.DataFrame`.
- Each row is validated field-by-field.
- If any validation fails, the row is skipped.
- Valid rows are upserted using `op.upsert()`.


## Error handling
- Rows with invalid fields are skipped and logged using `log.warning()`.
- Errors include specific reasons (e.g., invalid format, missing value).
- The `print_error_message()` function outputs detailed validation failures.
- Sync state is checkpointed after processing all rows.


## Tables created
The connector creates a `DATA` table:

```json
{
  "table": "data",
  "primary_key": ["int_value"],
  "columns": {
    "int_value": "INT",
    "long_value": "LONG",
    "bool_value": "BOOLEAN",
    "string_value": "STRING",
    "json_value": "JSON",
    "naive_date_value": "NAIVE_DATE",
    "naive_date_time_value": "NAIVE_DATETIME"
  }
}
```
