# Similarweb Connector SDK Example

This example demonstrates how to build a Fivetran Connector SDK integration for [Similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/), a digital intelligence platform that provides data, insights, and analytics about websites and apps. The connector pulls web traffic data from Similarweb's API for a configurable set of domains and countries, and delivers it to your Fivetran destination.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Supports batch report generation and download from Similarweb's API (see `request_report`, `check_report_status`, `download_report`)
* Configurable list of domains, countries, and metrics (see `domain_list`, `country_list`, `metric_list`)
* Handles both historical and incremental syncs (see `update` function)
* Delivers data to a single table: `all_traffic_visits`
* Uses Fivetran Connector SDK logging for status and error reporting (see `log` usage)

## Configuration file

The connector expects a `configuration.json` file with the following structure:

```
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_SIMILARWEB_API_KEY"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies any additional Python libraries required by the connector. For this example, the following libraries are required:

*Example content of `requirements.txt`:*

```
pytz
dateutil
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector uses an API key for authentication with Similarweb. You can obtain your API key from your Similarweb account dashboard. The key should be provided in the `configuration.json` file as the value for the `api_key` key. (See `update` function in `test.py`)

## Pagination

This connector does not implement explicit pagination. Data is retrieved in batch via report generation and download, as provided by the Similarweb API. (See `request_report`, `check_report_status`, and `download_report` functions)

## Data handling

* Data is requested from Similarweb using the `request_report` function
* The status of the report is checked using `check_report_status` 
* Once ready, the report is downloaded and parsed using `download_report` 
* Data is delivered to Fivetran using the `op.upsert` operation in the `update` function 
* The schema is defined in the `schema` function

## Error handling

* Uses Fivetran Connector SDK logging for info, warning, and severe error messages (see `log` usage throughout)
* Raises `RuntimeError` for failed report creation, failed status, or download errors (see `request_report`, `check_report_status`, `download_report`)

## Tables created

* `all_traffic_visits` – Contains daily web traffic metrics for each domain and country combination.

Sample data structure:

| domain           | country | date       | visits   | ... |
|------------------|---------|------------|----------|-----|
| example-website.com      | US      | 2024-05-01 | 1000000  | ... |

## Additional files

This example does not include additional files beyond the main connector script and configuration.
