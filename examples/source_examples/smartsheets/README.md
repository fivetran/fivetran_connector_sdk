# Smartsheet API Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to sync row-level data from a Smartsheet sheet using the Fivetran Connector SDK and the Smartsheet [getSheet API endpoint](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/sheets#operation/getSheet). It retrieves rows from a single sheet, dynamically maps columns using column IDs, and emits those rows to a destination table.

This example supports:
- Incremental syncs using `rowsModifiedSince`.
- Dynamic schema based on column headers.
- Optional row-level metadata.
- Configurable authentication and sheet selection.

This example is currently configured for a single sheet with no pagination. You can extend it to handle multiple sheets and pagination via the `includeAll=true` query parameter or the `page` and `pageSize` parameters.


## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started
Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Retrieves full sheet metadata and all rows using Smartsheetâ€™s Sheets API.
- Maps `columnId` to column names to construct each row as a flat dictionary.
- Includes row metadata fields like `rowNumber`, `createdAt`, and `modifiedAt`.
- Uses `rowsModifiedSince` to incrementally sync only updated rows.
- Uses `op.upsert()` for each row and checkpoints with the current sync timestamp.


## Configuration file
The connector requires the following configuration parameters:

```json
{
    "smartsheet_api_token": "your_api_token",
    "smartsheet_sheet_id": "your_smartsheet_sheet_id"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
This connector requires the following Python packages:

```
requests
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
Authentication is handled via a Bearer token using the Authorization header.


## Pagination
Pagination is not currently implemented in this example.


## Data handling
- Each row in the Smartsheet is returned as a dictionary of cell values, mapped to the correct column titles.
- Column names are dynamically derived from the `columns` array in the API response.
- Null or empty cells are ignored.


## Error handling
- API errors are surfaced using `requests.raise_for_status()`.
- Any failure in authentication, network, or sheet access will raise an exception.
- You can extend this with `try/except` blocks and log warnings for partial errors.


## Tables created
The connector creates a `SMARTSHEET_TABLE_NAME` table:

```json
{
  "table": "smartsheet_table_name",
  "primary_key": ["id"],
  "columns": {
    "id": "STRING",
    // Additional columns are inferred dynamically from the sheet structure.
  }
}
```
