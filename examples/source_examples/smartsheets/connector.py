# This is a simple example for how to work with the fivetran_connector_sdk module.
# Note: This code is currently configured to hit the getSheet endpoint and get data from 1 pre-defined sheet in Smartsheets that does not need pagination
# You will need to provide your own smartsheet credentials for this to work --> api_key variable in configuration.json together with the smartsheet sheet id
# getSheet endpoint: https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/tag/sheets#operation/getSheet
# Add Additional code in the update function to handle multiple sheets and/or pagination through sheets
# Can also add code to extract from other endpoints as needed
# See the Technical Reference documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update)
# and the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices) for details

# Define the schema function which lets you configure the schema your connector delivers.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the schema function:
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#schema

# - configuration: a dictionary that holds the configuration settings for the connector.

# - configuration: dictionary contains any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector
