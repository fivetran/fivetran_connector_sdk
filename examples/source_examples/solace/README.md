# Solace Connector Example

## Connector overview

This connector demonstrates how to sync data from a **Solace** queue using the [Fivetran Connector SDK](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk). It fetches messages from a durable Solace queue using the **Solace Messaging API**, processes the events, and upserts them into a destination table. The connector supports **incremental syncs** using message timestamps and checkpointing to ensure continuity.

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating system:
  * Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  * macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)


## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

- Connects to **Solace PubSub+** using the [Solace PubSub+ Python API](https://solace.dev).
- Pulls events from a **durable exclusive queue**.
- Supports **incremental data syncing** using timestamp-based filtering.
- Deduplicates messages using an internally generated `event_id`.
- Graceful error handling and logging.
- Tracks sync state for resumable operations.
- Optionally supports publishing test messages for development.


## Configuration

The connector expects the following configuration in the `configuration.json` file:

```json
{
    "solace_host": "<YOUR_SOLACE_HOST>",
    "solace_username": "<YOUR_SOLACE_USERNAME>",
    "solace_password": "<YOUR_SOLACE_PASSWORD>",
    "solace_vpn": "<YOUR_SOLACE_VPN>",
    "solace_queue": "<YOUR_SOLACE_QUEUE>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

Add the following to `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas==2.3.0
solace-pubsubplus==1.10.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

The connector authenticates to Solace using basic credentials and VPN configuration:

- `solace_host`: Solace broker host
- `solace_username`: Username for broker authentication
- `solace_password`: Password for broker authentication
- `solace_vpn`: VPN name (default is `default`)

SSL validation is disabled in local development. Modify the `SolaceAuth` class to enable certificate validation if required.

## Pagination

The connector consumes messages in batches from a durable, exclusive queue until the configured batch size limit is reached.

Messages are retrieved using:
```python
message = receiver.receive_message(timeout=1000)
```

This allows the connector to stream messages efficiently with timeout-based pagination

## Data handling

The connector processes events from Solace as follows:

- Establishes a connection to the Solace broker using durable queue subscriptions.
- Receives messages one at a time using Solaceâ€™s persistent message receiver.
- Parses each message payload (expects JSON structure).
- Extracts relevant metadata including timestamp, topic, and message ID.
- Skips and removes messages older than the last sync timestamp from queue.
- Constructs structured records and appends processing metadata.
- Deduplicates events using a combination of `event_id` and `timestamp`.
- Upserts cleaned records for inserting into the destination table.

Each event includes:

- `event_id`: A generated hash-based unique ID.
- `message_id`: Optional ID from the payload.
- `timestamp`: Event timestamp (from payload or receive time).
- `topic`: Source Solace topic or queue.
- `message_payload`: Raw message body.
- `message_type`: Type extracted from payload (default: `"raw"`).
- `details`: Optional field from payload.
- `processed_at`: Timestamp the message was processed.

## Error handling

This connector includes robust error handling at various stages:

- **Connection errors**: Fail fast with meaningful error messages if connection to the broker fails.
- **Message processing errors**: Malformed or unexpected payloads are logged and skipped without halting the sync.
- **Upsert failures**: Logged per record, allowing the connector to continue processing other events.
- **Timeouts and retries**: Configurable timeout ensures the sync completes even if the queue is empty or slow.

---

## Testing & local debugging

You can run the connector locally with a `configuration.json` file. The connector includes optional logic to publish test messages to a Solace topic:

```python
def publish_messages_for_testing(config: dict, count: int):
    publisher = SolacePublisher(
        host=config["solace_host"],
        username=config["solace_username"],
        password=config["solace_password"],
        topic_name="demo/topic",
        vpn=config.get("solace_vpn", "default")
    )

    publisher.connect()
    publisher.publish_messages(count)
```

This is helpful for development and testing. You can remove or comment this logic for production use.
