# Talon.one Connector

## Connector overview

This connector fetches event data from Talon.one using the Management API. The connector retrieves application events with pagination support and incremental sync capabilities.

The connector maintains one table:
- `event`: Contains application event data from Talon.one

## Requirements

* [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
* Operating System:  
  * Windows 10 or later  
  * macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
  * Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features

* Fetches application events from Talon.one Management API
* Supports incremental sync based on event creation time
* Implements pagination with configurable page size
* Rate limiting compliance (3 calls per second)
* Automatic JSON conversion for list-type fields
* Checkpointing for reliable data synchronization

## Configuration file

The connector requires configuration with your Talon.one credentials and sync settings:

```json
{
    "base_url": "https://<your_subdomain>.us-west1.talon.one/v1/", 
    "api_key": "<your_api_key>",        
    "page_size": "1000",                        
    "initial_sync_start_time": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.00Z"                          
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file

The connector uses minimal external dependencies. The `requirements.txt` file should be empty as all required packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication

This connector uses Talon.one Management API authentication:
- API Key authentication using `ManagementKey-v1` format
- Requires a valid Talon.one Management API key
- API key must be included in the Authorization header

## Data handling

The connector processes data in the following way:
1. Connects to Talon.one Management API using provided credentials
2. Fetches application events for the configured application ID (currently set to 5)
3. Implements pagination to handle large datasets
4. Converts list-type fields to JSON strings for database compatibility
5. Uses incremental sync based on `createdAfter` parameter

The connector uses incremental sync based on the `created` field to avoid duplicate data and ensure efficient synchronization.

## Error handling

The connector implements error handling for:
- HTTP request failures with `raise_for_status()`
- API rate limiting with sleep delays
- Empty response handling
- Pagination boundary conditions

All errors are logged using the Fivetran logging system for debugging and monitoring.

## Tables Created

The connector creates one table:

### event
Primary key: `id`
Contains application event data including:
- Event ID
- Event type and attributes
- Creation timestamp
- Application-specific event data
- Customer and session information
