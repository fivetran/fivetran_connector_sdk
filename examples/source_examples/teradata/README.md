# Teradata Vantage Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to use the Fivetran Connector SDK to extract data from a Teradata Vantage database using the `teradatasql` Python library. It fetches employee records from a specified table, incrementally syncs new records based on the `JoiningDate`, and upserts them into a destination table.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)   
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.


## Features
- Connects to Teradata Vantage using `teradatasql`
- Incremental sync based on `JoiningDate`
- Batch data fetching to optimize memory usage

## Configuration file
The connector uses a configuration file to specify connection details and table information.

```json
{
  "teradata_host": "<YOUR_TERADATA_HOST>",
  "teradata_user": "<YOUR_TERADATA_USER>",
  "teradata_password": "<YOUR_TERADATA_PASSWORD>",
  "teradata_database": "<YOUR_TERADATA_DATABASE>",
  "teradata_table": "<YOUR_TERADATA_TABLE>"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.


## Requirements file
The requirements.txt file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector.

```
teradatasql
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.


## Authentication
The connector authenticates to Teradata Vantage using username and password credentials provided in the configuration file. Obtain these credentials from your Teradata administrator.


## Pagination
Data is fetched in batches using the fetchmany method with a configurable batch size (`__BATCH_SIZE`).
Refer to method `fetch_and_upsert_data(cursor, configuration, state)`.


## Data handling
- Data is selected from the source table where `JoiningDate` is greater than the last synced value.
- Each row is converted to a dictionary and upserted into the destination table.
- The state is updated with the latest `JoiningDate` after each batch.
Refer to method `fetch_and_upsert_data(cursor, configuration, state)`.


## Error handling
- Configuration validation raises a `ValueError` if required keys are missing.
- Connection errors raise a `ConnectionError`.
- All exceptions during update are caught and re-raised as `RuntimeError`.
- Database connections and cursors are closed in a `finally` block.

## Tables created
- employee: Contains columns `EmployeeID` (INT, primary key) and `JoiningDate` (NAIVE_DATE).

Additional columns are inferred from the source table.
