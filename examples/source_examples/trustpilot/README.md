## Production vs Development Configuration

### **ðŸš€ Production Deployment (Recommended)**
- **Method**: GitHub Actions workflow with GitHub secrets
- **Security**: Credentials stored securely in GitHub
- **Automation**: Push-to-deploy workflow
- **Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security practices

### **ðŸ”§ Development & Testing (Available)**
- **Method**: Local `configuration.json` or environment variables
- **Security**: Credentials stored locally (never commit to repository)
- **Use Case**: Local development, debugging, testing
- **Guidance**: We recommend using GitHub secrets for production

**ðŸ’¡ Security Note**: For production deployments, we recommend using **GitHub secrets**. Local configuration files are available for development but we encourage using GitHub secrets for production environments.

**API Key Setup:**
1. Go to your Trustpilot Business account
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
4. Add the API key to `configuration.json`

**Business Unit ID:**
- Found in your Trustpilot Business dashboard
- Used to scope data extraction to specific business units

**Consumer ID:**
- Found in consumer profile URLs or API responses
- Used to fetch individual consumer review history

Note: We recommend keeping the `configuration.json` file out of version control to protect sensitive information. You can add it to your `.gitignore` file for additional security.

### **Development Configuration (Local Testing)**

ðŸ’¡ **Development Setup**: The following configuration methods are designed for local development and testing. We recommend using GitHub secrets for production deployments.

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variables locally
export TRUSTPILOT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export TRUSTPILOT_BUSINESS_UNIT_ID="your_business_unit_id"
export TRUSTPILOT_CONSUMER_ID="your_consumer_id"

# Option 2: Use configuration.json file (never commit this file)
# Update configuration.json with your test credentials
```

**Production Deployment**: We recommend using the GitHub Actions workflow with GitHub secrets (see [Deployment](#deployment) section above).

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector for Trustpilot API integration and data processing.

**Example content of `requirements.txt`:**

```
requests>=2.28.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` package (v2.0.0+) is pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`. This connector uses the updated SDK version that does not require `yield` statements for operations.

## Authentication

The connector uses Trustpilot API keys for authentication with the REST API. Authentication is provided through:

1. **API Keys**: Direct Trustpilot API key in configuration
2. **Business Unit Access**: Business unit ID for data scope definition

**Required API Permissions:**
- REST API access for querying business data
- Business unit-level access for the specified business unit ID
- Read permissions for reviews, consumers, and invitations

We recommend reviewing these permissions with your Trustpilot account administrator to ensure proper access levels.

**Steps to obtain credentials:**
1. Go to your Trustpilot Business account
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
4. **For Production**: We recommend adding credentials as GitHub secrets (see [Deployment](#deployment) section)
5. **For Development**: You can add credentials to `configuration.json` (remember not to commit this file)

## Pagination

The connector handles data retrieval from Trustpilot REST API with efficient pagination:

- **Reviews API**: Limited to 100 results per page with time-based filtering
- **Consumers API**: Supports pagination for large result sets
- **Invitations API**: Implements pagination for invitation data
- **Data Volume Management**: Uses appropriate time ranges to manage data volume
- **Incremental Syncs**: Implements incremental syncs to reduce data transfer

The connector implements efficient data handling by:
- Processing complete API responses in memory
- Using appropriate time ranges to manage data volume
- Implementing incremental syncs to reduce data transfer
- Applying filters to focus on relevant data subsets

Refer to functions `get_reviews_data`, `get_business_data`, `get_categories_data`, `get_consumers_data`, and `get_invitations_data` in `connector.py` for the data retrieval implementation.

## Dynamic Time Range Management

The connector intelligently manages data fetching based on sync type:

### **Initial Sync**
- **Time Range**: Last 90 days of data
- **Use Case**: First-time setup or full re-sync
- **Data Volume**: Comprehensive historical data for baseline analysis

### **Incremental Sync**
- **Time Range**: Data since last successful sync timestamp
- **Use Case**: Regular scheduled syncs
- **Data Volume**: Only new/changed data since last sync
- **Benefits**: Faster sync times, reduced API calls, efficient resource usage

### **Implementation Details**
- **State Management**: Uses Fivetran's checkpoint system to track last sync time
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically determines sync type based on state
- **Flexible Queries**: All API calls dynamically adjust time ranges
- **Logging**: Clear indication of sync type and time ranges in logs

## Data handling

The connector processes Trustpilot data through several stages:

1. **Data Extraction**: Direct REST API calls to Trustpilot endpoints
2. **Data Transformation**: Conversion of Trustpilot API responses to structured table format
3. **Schema Mapping**: Consistent data types and column naming across all tables
4. **State Management**: Checkpoint-based incremental sync support
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with logging and validation

**Data Processing Features:**
- **Type Conversion**: Trustpilot API responses converted to appropriate data types
- **Default Values**: Missing dimensions populated with appropriate defaults
- **Timestamp Handling**: ISO format timestamp conversion and period-based grouping
- **Data Aggregation**: Multiple metric aggregations (counts, averages, percentages)
- **Filtering**: Business unit and time-based filtering based on configuration
- **Dynamic Time Ranges**: Intelligent time range selection for initial vs incremental syncs

**Data Flow:**
Trustpilot REST API â†’ Requests Client â†’ Dynamic Time Range Processing â†’ Data Processing Functions â†’ Fivetran Operations â†’ Data Warehouse Tables

Refer to functions `get_time_range`, `execute_api_request`, `get_reviews_data`, `get_business_data`, `get_categories_data`, `get_consumers_data`, and `get_invitations_data` in `connector.py` for detailed data handling logic.

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies to ensure robust operation:

**Configuration Validation Errors:**
- **ValueError**: Missing required configuration values (`api_key`, `business_unit_id`, `consumer_id`)
- **ValueError**: Empty API key, business unit ID, or consumer ID values

**API Request Errors:**
- **RequestException**: Handles network timeouts, connection errors, and HTTP failures
- **RuntimeError**: Manages API request failures and query execution errors

**Sync Operation Errors:**
- **RuntimeError**: Handles general sync failures with detailed error messages
- **Logging**: Uses Fivetran's logging system with info and severe levels for comprehensive reporting

**Error Handling Implementation:**
- **Early Validation**: Configuration parameters validated before API calls
- **Exception Propagation**: Errors are logged and re-raised for Fivetran to handle
- **State Preservation**: Checkpoint system maintains sync state across failures

Refer to functions `validate_configuration`, `execute_api_request`, and the main `update` function in `connector.py` for error handling implementation.
