## Configuration file

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDANCE: For production deployments, we recommend using **GitHub secrets** configured in the GitHub Actions workflow. Local configuration files can be used for development and testing, but we encourage using GitHub secrets for production environments.

The connector requires the following configuration keys. For production deployments, we recommend configuring these as **GitHub secrets** (see [Deployment](#deployment) section). For local development and testing, you can define them in `configuration.json`:

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_TRUSTPILOT_API_KEY",
  "business_unit_id": "YOUR_BUSINESS_UNIT_ID",
  "consumer_id": "YOUR_CONSUMER_ID",
  "sync_frequency_hours": "YOUR_SYNC_FREQUENCY_HOURS",
  "initial_sync_days": "YOUR_INITIAL_SYNC_DAYS",
  "max_records_per_page": "YOUR_MAX_RECORDS_PER_PAGE",
  "request_timeout_seconds": "YOUR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS",
  "retry_attempts": "YOUR_RETRY_ATTEMPTS",
  "enable_incremental_sync": "YOUR_ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_SYNC",
  "enable_consumer_reviews": "YOUR_ENABLE_CONSUMER_REVIEWS",
  "enable_invitation_links": "YOUR_ENABLE_INVITATION_LINKS",
  "enable_categories": "YOUR_ENABLE_CATEGORIES",
  "data_retention_days": "YOUR_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS",
  "enable_debug_logging": "YOUR_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING"
}
```

Required configuration keys:
- `api_key`: Trustpilot API key for REST API access
- `business_unit_id`: Trustpilot business unit ID for data extraction

Optional configuration keys:
- `consumer_id`: Trustpilot consumer ID for fetching individual consumer reviews (required only when `enable_consumer_reviews` is true)
- `sync_frequency_hours`: Sync frequency in hours (1-24, default: 4)
- `initial_sync_days`: Days of historical data for initial sync (1-365, default: 90)
- `max_records_per_page`: Maximum records per API page (1-100, default: 100)
- `request_timeout_seconds`: API request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- `retry_attempts`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: 3)
- `enable_incremental_sync`: Enable incremental sync (true/false, default: true)
- `enable_consumer_reviews`: Enable consumer reviews data fetching (true/false, default: false)
- `enable_invitation_links`: Enable invitation links data fetching (true/false, default: true)
- `enable_categories`: Enable categories data fetching (true/false, default: true)
- `data_retention_days`: Data retention period in days (default: 730)
- `enable_debug_logging`: Enable debug logging (true/false, default: false)

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by the connector for Trustpilot API integration and data processing.

Example content of `requirements.txt`:

```
requests>=2.28.0
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` package (v2.0.0+) is pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare it in your `requirements.txt`. This connector uses the updated SDK version that does not require `yield` statements for operations.

## Authentication

The connector uses Trustpilot API keys for authentication with the REST API. Authentication is provided through:

1. API keys: Direct Trustpilot API key in configuration.
2. Business unit access: Business unit ID for data scope definition.

Required API Permissions:
- REST API access for querying business data
- Business unit-level access for the specified business unit ID
- Read permissions for reviews, consumers, and invitations

We recommend reviewing these permissions with your Trustpilot account administrator to ensure proper access levels.

Steps to obtain credentials:
1. Go to your Trustpilot Business account.
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys.
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions.
4. For production: We recommend adding credentials as **GitHub Secrets** (see [Deployment](#deployment) section).
5. For development: You can add credentials to `configuration.json` (remember not to commit this file).

## Pagination

The connector handles data retrieval from Trustpilot REST API with efficient pagination:

- Reviews API: Limited to 100 results per page with time-based filtering
- Consumers API: Supports pagination for large result sets
- Invitations API: Implements pagination for invitation data
- Data volume management: Uses appropriate time ranges to manage data volume
- Incremental syncs: Implements incremental syncs to reduce data transfer

The connector implements efficient data handling by:
- Processing complete API responses in memory
- Using appropriate time ranges to manage data volume
- Implementing incremental syncs to reduce data transfer
- Applying filters to focus on relevant data subsets

Refer to functions `get_reviews_data`, `get_business_data`, `get_categories_data`, `get_consumers_data`, and `get_invitations_data` in `connector.py` for the data retrieval implementation.

## Dynamic Time Range Management

The connector intelligently manages data fetching based on sync type:

### Initial sync
- Time range: Last 90 days of data
- Use case: First-time setup or full re-sync
- Data volume: Comprehensive historical data for baseline analysis

### Incremental sync
- Time range: Data since last successful sync timestamp
- Use case: Regular scheduled syncs
- Data volume: Only new/changed data since last sync
- Benefits: Faster sync times, reduced API calls, efficient resource usage

### Implementation details
- State management: Uses Fivetran's checkpoint system to track last sync time
- Automatic detection: Automatically determines sync type based on state
- Flexible queries: All API calls dynamically adjust time ranges
- Logging: Clear indication of sync type and time ranges in logs

## Data handling

The connector processes Trustpilot data through several stages:

1. Data extraction: Direct REST API calls to Trustpilot endpoints.
2. Data transformation: Conversion of Trustpilot API responses to structured table format.
3. Schema mapping: Consistent data types and column naming across all tables.
4. State management: Checkpoint-based incremental sync support.
5. Error handling: Comprehensive error handling with logging and validation.

Data Processing Features:
- Type conversion: Trustpilot API responses converted to appropriate data types
- Default values: Missing dimensions populated with appropriate defaults
- Timestamp handling: ISO format timestamp conversion and period-based grouping
- Data aggregation: Multiple metric aggregations (counts, averages, percentages)
- Filtering: Business unit and time-based filtering based on configuration
- Dynamic rime ranges: Intelligent time range selection for initial vs incremental syncs

Data Flow:
Trustpilot REST API → Requests Client → Dynamic Time Range Processing → Data Processing Functions → Fivetran Operations → Data Warehouse Tables

Refer to functions `get_time_range`, `execute_api_request`, `get_reviews_data`, `get_business_data`, `get_categories_data`, `get_consumers_data`, and `get_invitations_data` in `connector.py` for detailed data handling logic.

## Error handling

The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies to ensure robust operation:

Configuration validation errors:
- ValueError: Missing required configuration values (`api_key`, `business_unit_id`, `consumer_id`)
- ValueError: Empty API key, business unit ID, or consumer ID values

API request errors:
- RequestException: Handles network timeouts, connection errors, and HTTP failures
- RuntimeError: Manages API request failures and query execution errors

Sync operation errors:
- RuntimeError: Handles general sync failures with detailed error messages
- Logging: Uses Fivetran's logging system with info and severe levels for comprehensive reporting

Error handling implementation:
- Early validation: Configuration parameters validated before API calls
- Exception propagation: Errors are logged and re-raised for Fivetran to handle
- State preservation: Checkpoint system maintains sync state across failures

Refer to functions `validate_configuration`, `execute_api_request`, and the main `update` function in `connector.py` for error handling implementation.
