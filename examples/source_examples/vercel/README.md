# Vercel Connector Example

## Connector overview
This connector demonstrates how to fetch deployment data from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)  and upsert it into your destination using the Fivetran Connector SDK. The custom connector synchronizes deployment records from your personal Vercel account and implements pagination handling to efficiently process large datasets with incremental synchronization using timestamps.

## Requirements
- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
    - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
    - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
    - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

## Getting started
Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

## Features
- Synchronizes deployments from Vercel API `/v6/deployments` endpoint
- Supports both personal account and team resource access
- Implements pagination handling for large datasets with configurable limit 
- Incremental synchronization using timestamp-based state management 
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic for API requests

## Configuration file
The configuration keys required for your connector are as follows:

```json
{
  "api_token": "YOUR_VERCEL_API_TOKEN",
  "team_id": "<YOUR_TEAM_ID_OPTIONAL>"
}
```

### Configuration parameters

- `api_token` (required): Your Vercel access token for API authentication
- `team_id` (optional): Team identifier to access team resources instead of a personal account. If not provided, the connector accesses your personal account resources.

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

## Requirements file
The connector uses the `requests` library for HTTP communication, which is pre-installed in the Fivetran environment.

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk:latest` and `requests:latest` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment. To avoid dependency conflicts, do not declare them in your `requirements.txt`.

## Authentication
The connector uses Vercel access tokens for authentication. To obtain your API token:

1. Go to your [Vercel account settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).
2. Click **Create Token**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the token.
4. Choose the appropriate scope.
5. Select an expiration date.
6. Make a note of the generated token. You will use it as the `api_token` in your connector's configuration.

## Team access
By default, the connector accesses resources from your personal Vercel account. To access deployments owned by a team:

1. **Find your Team ID**: Navigate to your team settings in Vercel dashboard or use the Vercel CLI.
2. **Add team_id to configuration**: Include the `team_id` parameter in your configuration.json file.
3. **Team permissions**: Ensure your API token has the necessary permissions to access the team's resources.

When `team_id` is provided, the connector will append `?teamId=[teamID]` to the API endpoint URL to access team resources instead of personal account resources.

## Pagination
The connector implements Vercel's timestamp-based pagination system as described in the API documentation. It processes data in configurable batches and uses the `next` timestamp from the pagination response to fetch subsequent pages.

## Data handling
The connector processes data from the Vercel `/v6/deployments` endpoint which contains deployment records with status, timing, and build information. All nested JSON structures are flattened to create optimal table schemas for your destination. 

## Error handling
The connector implements comprehensive error handling strategies:
- HTTP timeout handling with configurable timeout values (30 seconds)
- Rate limiting detection with exponential backoff
- Specific exception handling for different request failures
- Graceful error logging without exposing sensitive information
- Retry logic for transient errors

## Tables created
The connector creates one main table:

### deployments
- **Primary Key**: `uid`
- Contains deployment records with status, timing, and build information flattened from the `/v6/deployments` endpoint
- Includes flattened projectSettings data when available
