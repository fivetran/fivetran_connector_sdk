"""Existence-aware wrapper around `fivetran deploy`, driven entirely by env vars.

Used by action/action.yml (the composite action) -- see action/README.md for the
behavior this implements. In short:

- CONFIGURATION_JSON, if non-empty, is pushed as-is -- whether that creates a
  connection or updates an existing one. Its mere presence is the only signal:
  don't compute/pass it unless you actually want it pushed to the live
  connection right now (the caller workflow controls that, e.g. by only
  running its "assemble config" step on a deliberate manual trigger).
- If CONFIGURATION_JSON is empty, this is a code-only deploy. The `fivetran`
  CLI itself already knows whether CONNECTION_NAME exists -- we don't
  re-detect that. If the CLI rejects the code-only deploy because the
  connection doesn't exist yet (a first deploy needs *some* configuration),
  retry once with a placeholder file (EMPTY_CONFIG_PATH, default
  configuration.example.json) so the connection still gets created -- paused,
  "needs attention" -- with its setup form ready for someone to fill in via
  the dashboard.
- The `fivetran deploy` CLI always creates new connections paused -- it
  hardcodes that and exposes no flag to change it. ACTIVATE_ON_CREATE is a
  one-time switch, not an ongoing desired state: if it's true and *this run*
  just created the connection with real configuration (status "created", not
  "created_needs_setup"), we unpause it afterwards with a direct call to the
  Fivetran API. It has no effect on any other run -- a redeploy of an
  existing connection (status "updated") never touches its current
  paused/active state, whatever that is.
- Regardless of ACTIVATE_ON_CREATE, whenever a connection ID is known we
  read the connection's *current* paused state back from the Fivetran API
  and report it as the "active" output. This is independent of what this run
  did, so it's the only way to learn whether an existing connection is
  active on a plain redeploy.
