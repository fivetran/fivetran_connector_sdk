# This connector demonstrates schema changes by returning data with different types
# First sync: int_to_string field is an integer (42)
# Second sync: int_to_string field is a float (42.42)
# Third sync: int_to_string field is a non-numeric string ("forty-two point forty-two")
# Fourth+ syncs: int_to_string field is a float again (42.43)

# Import required modules from the Fivetran Connector SDK
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Connector # For supporting Connector operations like Update() and Schema()
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Logging as log # For enabling Logs in your connector code
from fivetran_connector_sdk import Operations as op # For supporting Data operations like Upsert(), Update(), Delete() and checkpoint()
import json

# Define the update function, which is a required function, and is called by Fivetran during each sync.
# See the technical reference documentation for more details on the update function
# https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/technical-reference#update
# The function takes two parameters:
# - configuration: dictionary contains any secrets or payloads you configure when deploying the connector
# - state: a dictionary contains whatever state you have chosen to checkpoint during the prior sync
# The state dictionary is empty for the first sync or for any full re-sync
