# This connector demonstrates schema changes by returning data with different types
# First sync: int_to_string field is an integer (42)
# Second sync: int_to_string field is a float (42.42)
# Third sync: int_to_string field is a non-numeric string ("forty-two point forty-two")
# Fourth+ syncs: int_to_string field is a float again (42.43)
