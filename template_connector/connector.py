"""
GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW WHILE WRITING AN EXAMPLE CONNECTOR:
- Import only the necessary modules and libraries to keep the code clean and efficient.
- Use clear, consistent and descriptive names for your functions and variables.
- For constants and global variables, use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g. CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL, TABLE_NAME).
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each function in the docstring.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of complex logic within functions, where necessary.
- Add comments to highlight where users can make changes to the code to suit their specific use case.
- Split your code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability where required.
- Use logging to provide useful information about the connector's execution. Do not log excessively.
- Implement error handling to catch exceptions and log them appropriately. Catch specific exceptions where possible.
- Define the complete data model with primary key and data types in the schema function.
- Ensure that the connector does not load all data into memory at once. This can cause memory overflow errors. Use pagination or streaming where possible.
- Add comments to explain pagination or streaming logic to help users understand how to handle large datasets.
- Add comments for upsert, update and delete to explain the purpose of upsert, update and delete. This will help users understand the upsert, update and delete processes.
- Checkpoint your state at regular intervals to ensure that the connector can resume from the last successful sync in case of interruptions.
- Add comments for checkpointing to explain the purpose of checkpoint. This will help users understand the checkpointing process.
- Refer to the Best Practices documentation (https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/best-practices)
