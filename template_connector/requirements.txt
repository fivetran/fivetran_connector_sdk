# Add your connector's dependencies here, one per line with explicit versions.
# Keep packages in alphabetical order for easier maintenance.
# 
# Example:
# pandas==2.0.3
# 
# Note: fivetran_connector_sdk and requests are pre-installed in the base environment
# and should not be included in this file.
#
# Best practices:
# - Use explicit versions (==) for reproducibility
# - Only include packages actually used by your connector
# - Add comments to explain why a package is needed if it's not obvious
#
# This file can be safely removed if your connector has no external dependencies.
